// ADR-0031 — integrity as a multi-hash carrier with origin tags
// (amends ADR-0014 §4.F1).
//
// Graph-canonical integrity is `Integrity { hashes: Hash[] }`: every algorithm
// present on disk and every member of a space-joined SRI is preserved verbatim,
// each digest tagged with its ORIGIN. `origin` distinguishes an SRI-emittable
// TARBALL digest (`sri`/`registry`/`recomputed`) from the two field-specific
// digests: `berry-zip` (Yarn Berry's `checksum` — a digest of the post-processed
// zip-cache, NOT the tarball) and `url-fragment` (the yarn-classic `resolved#<sha1>`
// tarball sha1, which rides the resolved URL fragment). Both are excluded from the
// SRI field and from SRI equivalence.
//
// Emit is origin-aware: a tarball SRI digest is never written into a berry
// `checksum`, a `berry-zip` digest is never written into an SRI field, and the
// `url-fragment` sha1 is written only into the yarn-classic resolved URL. When no
// compatible-origin digest exists the field is OMITTED (the adapter emits a soft
// `RECIPE_INTEGRITY_INCOMPLETE`), never fabricated — a tarball sha512 re-encoded
// into a berry `checksum` is a value real yarn rejects on install.
//
// Digests are stored as lowercase hex of the raw digest bytes; SRI base64 ↔ hex
// translation happens only at the parse/emit boundary so every algorithm and
// origin compares uniformly. Integrity is NOT part of NodeId / TarballKey
// (ADR-0010/0011) — this carrier is `TarballPayload` data only.
