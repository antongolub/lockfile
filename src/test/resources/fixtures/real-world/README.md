# Real-world lockfile fixtures

These fixtures are snapshots from real repositories, not synthetic templates.
They exist to exercise cross-family conversion against graph shapes emitted by
actual package-manager workflows.

Conversion behaviour here is empirical and exploratory. The corresponding probe
test validates that each conversion either:

- emits target output that the target adapter accepts and reparses, or
- fails with a classified error shape

Unlike `fixtures/lockfiles/`, these files are not contract-pinned loss
profiles. They preserve the original source filenames (`yarn.lock`,
`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `bun.lock`) and the probe detects the
source format at runtime.

Fixtures with `__metadata.version: 7` were emitted by Yarn 4 during a brief
intermediate lockfile-format window between v6 and v8. The `yarn-berry-v7`
adapter (added per `implementer/yarn-berry-v7-adapter` dispatch) maps the
transitional shape onto the shared `_yarn-berry-core` family pipeline
(quoted-protocol ranges like v8/v9 + raw-hex checksum like v4/v5/v6 +
`conditions:` blocks per the v5+ inheritance).

### Sister-session canary import — Yarn 4 large monorepos

Discovered via the `yarn-audit-fix` sister-session's real-world canary
(first run against `lockgraph@0.0.0-snapshot.45`, 2026-05-28).
Re-pinned 2026-05-29 to exact commits: each fixture's directory handle is
`<space>-<repo>-<branch>-<sha7>` and its `yarn.lock` is byte-identical to
that commit's `yarn.lock` (re-fetched from `raw.githubusercontent.com` at
the recorded SHA — provenance is verifiable, not approximate).

| Repo handle | Source repo | Stars | Branch | Format | Historically exercised |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |

All nine now parse + round-trip clean at HEAD (9/9). Bugs #1–#5 are fixed
and additionally pinned by synthetic unit tests (`graph.test.ts`,
`yarn-berry-v9.test.ts`); these real-world fixtures provide breadth-canary
coverage. Note the 2026-05-29 re-pin moved `facebook-jest` from a v9 to a
v10 lockfile (the repo regenerated upstream), which now also exercises the
`yarn-berry-v10` adapter against a published-self-link graph.

### Cross-PM exotic fixtures — pnpm / npm / bun

Added to broaden the corpus beyond yarn (the overrides/resolutions sweep + the
L1 `Manifest` model). Directory handle is `<space>-<repo>-<branch>-<sha7>`; the
lockfile is byte-identical to that commit, re-fetched from
`raw.githubusercontent.com` at the `<sha7>` commit. **Nested workspace-member
`package.json` (and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) are fetched preserving the repo's
folder hierarchy** so the manifest model (ADR-0025) gets the full per-workspace
tree, not just the root — a nested package that is itself a workspace root can
carry its own `overrides`.

| Repo handle | Source repo | Branch | Lockfile | Root overrides |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `directus-directus-main-4290f6e` | `https://github.com/directus/directus` | `main` | `pnpm-v9` | `pnpm.overrides`: 22 |
| `vitejs-vite-main-646dbed` | `https://github.com/vitejs/vite` | `main` | `pnpm-v9` | — |
| `vuejs-core-main-86ad076` | `https://github.com/vuejs/core` | `main` | `pnpm-v9` | — |
| `nrwl-nx-master-0939540` | `https://github.com/nrwl/nx` | `master` | `pnpm-v9` | — |
| `supabase-supabase-master-a4334a2` | `https://github.com/supabase/supabase` | `master` | `pnpm-v9` | — |
| `angular-angular-main-45e8fb5` | `https://github.com/angular/angular` | `main` | `pnpm-v9` | `resolutions`: 1 |
| `microsoft-vscode-main-ddd12d5` | `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode` | `main` | `npm` | `overrides`: 5 |
| `microsoft-TypeScript-main-f3d3968` | `https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript` | `main` | `npm` | `overrides`: 1 |
| `socketio-socket.io-main-190572d` | `https://github.com/socketio/socket.io` | `main` | `npm` | `overrides`: 3 |
| `facebook-create-react-app-main-6254386` | `https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app` | `main` | `npm` | — |
| `lodash-lodash-main-a023532` | `https://github.com/lodash/lodash` | `main` | `npm` | — |
| `oven-sh-bun-main-3a79bd7` | `https://github.com/oven-sh/bun` | `main` | `bun` | `resolutions`: 3 |
| `honojs-hono-main-2cbeadd` | `https://github.com/honojs/hono` | `main` | `bun` | — |

The override declarations feed the ADR-0025 capture path: pnpm `overrides:` and
npm `packages[""].overrides` round-trip through the lock (captured on parse);
yarn-style `resolutions` (angular, bun) live only in `package.json` and surface
via `ParseOptions.manifests` + `overridesOf(graph)` (A2).

### Yarn lockfile-version diversity

Fills the version gaps below the yarn-monorepo table (which spans v6–v10).
`webpack` is a current yarn-classic (v1) lock; `jest` is pinned to its `v26.6.0`
release — a `__metadata: version: 4` berry lock (jest migrated classic → berry
between 26.0 and 26.3, then to v10 at HEAD, exercised separately as
`facebook-jest-main-…`). Real-world `__metadata: version: 5` is **not**
represented — it was a razor-thin yarn-2.2/2.4 sub-window (every tag probed in
that range emitted v4); the synthetic `fixtures/lockfiles/` corpus covers the v5
adapter.

| Repo handle | Source repo | Branch / tag | Lockfile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `webpack-webpack-main-66f71f8` | `https://github.com/webpack/webpack` | `main` | `yarn-classic` (v1) |
| `jestjs-jest-v26.6.0-b254fd8` | `https://github.com/jestjs/jest` | `v26.6.0` | `yarn-berry-v4` (`__metadata.version: 4`) |
