# CONVERT — the conversion reference

How every lockfile format converts to every other: what aligns, what a target
cannot represent (a dedicated **Lost / breaks** column), what must be supplied
from `package.json`, and what — if anything — is pulled from the registry.

## 0. The conversion model

Every conversion uses one canonical pipeline. There are no pairwise converters:

```text
parse(source lock) → Graph → enrich(Graph, sources, target)? [staged] → stringify(target)
```

The unified `enrich` facade and composite project input are staged; the current
public status of each pipeline surface is summarized below.

- **Parse** reads the source snapshot into the package-manager-independent L2
  `Graph`. It may also consume explicitly supplied local context, such as
  repository manifests or patch files, but never consults a registry implicitly.
- **Enrich** is an opt-in, target-aware top-up. It fills only facts established by
  caller-supplied sources and leaves every unresolved or conflicting fact as a
  diagnosed gap. It never fabricates a checksum, version, manifest field, policy,
  or workspace relation.
- **Stringify** projects the graph into the target format and is always offline.
  It cannot recover information absent from both the graph and its evidence.

The enrichment vocabulary separates authorities that are often conflated:

| Source | Supplies | I/O boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository manifests | Root/workspace topology, dependency kinds, authored overrides | Offline `package.json` content keyed by workspace path (`''` = root) |
| Registry adapter | Missing transitive resolutions and exact-version package manifests | Optional caller-controlled registry/cache reads; no tarball bytes |
| Artifact source | Tarball bytes or a package-manager-owned cached checksum | Optional caller-controlled cache/network reads for target hash recomputation |
| Package-manager config evidence | A modeled, complete policy surface; initially overrides only | Already parsed evidence; unmodeled `.npmrc`/`.yarnrc.yml` facts do not upgrade completeness |

Registry and artifact reads are distinct: a packument can prove package metadata
or a tarball SRI, but it cannot reproduce a Yarn Berry cache-zip checksum without
the artifact bytes (or a checksum produced by Yarn itself). Live registry results
are time-varying; cross-run determinism requires a frozen/snapshotted adapter.

### Contracts and required sources

The requested contract determines how much of the composite project must be
known. Cells are conditional minimums: the target capability table may require
more, while a source that already carries authoritative facts may require less.

| Contract | Source lock | Repository manifests | Registry manifests | Artifact source | PM config | Native oracle |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`snapshot`** | Required; must establish the selected graph | Required for manifest-blind facts (notably Yarn Classic root, members, and dependency kinds) | Only for missing transitives or target-consumed facts absent from the source | Only when the target requires a hash form not derivable from the graph | — | — |
| **`policy`** | As snapshot | Root/workspace authored override policy where the source lock is not the authority | As snapshot | As snapshot | Required when the applicable manager generation stores override policy outside `package.json` | — |
| **`project`** | As policy | Complete root and workspace manifest set | Authoritative exact-version manifests for every non-workspace package whose required metadata is not already proven | Required for target-specific artifact hashes that must survive immutable installation | As policy | — |
| **`frozen`** | As project | As project | As project | As project | As project | Successful frozen/immutable installation by the exact target manager and recorded platform/config/input tuple |

Yarn Classic and npm lockfile v1 are the principal manifest-blind sources. A
`yarn.lock` has no project root and may omit independent workspace members; it
also cannot classify root declarations as dev or peer without manifests. These
are source limitations, not target stringifier defects.

Target refinements remain target-specific. For example, Berry checksum generation
needs the intended Berry format/cache key plus artifact bytes, while pnpm override
placement depends on the exact manager generation. Ambiguous target generations
remain unassessed rather than selecting a convenient default.

### Raw and certified emission

The public family is a 2 × 2 model rather than four unrelated conversion paths:

| Input | Raw projection | Certified projection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Graph` | `stringify(format, graph, options)` | `stringifyAssessed(graph, { target, contract, evidence })` |
| Lock input | `convert(input, { from, to, ...options })` | `convertAssessed(input, options)` / `convertProject(input, options)` |

Certified functions return structured assessments and withhold output unless the
requested contract is satisfied. Raw emission is strict by default: raw
`stringify` shares the certified **target-projection** gate, while raw `convert`
additionally requires snapshot/source readiness. `strict: false` explicitly
selects the historical best-effort byte path.

A strict failure is enrichable only when a named source can establish the missing
fact. Inherent target loss requires explicit best-effort opt-in. A field that a
mutable install can refill is still a strict failure when an immutable/frozen
install would rewrite or reject the lock; Berry checksums are the canonical
example.

### Implementation status

The contract vocabulary and assessment framework, evidence ledger, companion
projection, bundled `convertProject` API, target-aware unified `enrich` facade,
composite project input, strict raw projection, and frozen candidate/certification
lifecycle are implemented. Raw `stringify` and `convert` are strict by default;
`strict: false` is the explicit best-effort escape hatch.

Formats and the package-manager versions behind them:

| Family | Format ids | PM versions | Lock file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| npm | `npm-1`, `npm-2`, `npm-3`, `npm-4` | npm 5–6 / 7–8 / 9+ / 12+ feature-triggered (lockfileVersion 1/2/3/4) | `package-lock.json` |
| yarn classic | `yarn-classic` | yarn 1.x | `yarn.lock` |
| yarn berry | `yarn-berry-v4` … `yarn-berry-v10` | yarn 2/3/4 (`__metadata.version` 4–10) | `yarn.lock` |
| pnpm | `pnpm-v5`, `pnpm-v6`, `pnpm-v9` | pnpm 3–7 / 7–8 / 9+ | `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| bun | `bun-text` | bun 1.2+ (textual `bun.lock`; binary `bun.lockb` is unsupported and must be migrated first) | `bun.lock` |
| lockgraph | `lockgraph` | — (the L2 graph serialized; lossless round-trip) | — |

The table above records parser/emitter support, not a claim that every
cross-format pair is lossless. The interop contract matrix currently backs all
28 non-v10 npm-4 incident pairs; their npm-native carrier losses are listed
below and fail closed in strict mode. The 30 yarn-berry-v10 incident pairs are
the next unclosed group and are not yet contract-covered.

## Expressiveness — what each family can represent

A target loses a feature exactly when it is `✗` for that target but present in the
source. `~` = representable only with `manifests`, or in a degraded form.

| Feature | npm-1 | npm-2/3 | npm-4 | yarn-classic | yarn-berry | pnpm-v5/6 | pnpm-v9 | bun-text |
| --- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Project root in lock | ✗ | ✓ (`""`) | ✓ (`""`) | ✗ (rootless) | ✓ (`root@workspace:.`) | ✓ (`importers`) | ✓ (`importers['.']`) | ✓ (`workspaces[""]`) |
| Workspaces (members) | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ~ (needs manifests) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `workspace:` protocol | ✗ | ~ (`*` + `link`) | ~ (`*` + `link`) | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Peer virtualization | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (`virtual:`) | ✓ (key suffix) | ✓ (snapshot key) | ✗ |
| `dev` / `peer` edge distinction | ~ (flags) | ✓ | ✓ | ~ (needs manifests) | ✓ | ✓ | ~ (from reachability) | ✓ |
| `optional` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `peerDependenciesMeta` | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ~ (declarative) |
| Overrides / resolutions block | ✗ | ✗ (manifest-only) | ✗ (manifest-only) | ✗ (rewrites entry key) | ✗ (manifest-only) | ✓ (`overrides:`) | ✓ | ✓ (npm-shaped) |
| Native patch carrier | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (same-format replay) | ✗ | ✓ (per-node) | ✓ | ✓ | ~ (top-level map only) |
| Manifest-extension fingerprint / applied provenance | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (same-format replay) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `conditions` (os/cpu/libc gate) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (v5+) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| `catalog:` protocol | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (9.5+) | ✗ |
| Integrity form | tarball SRI | tarball SRI | tarball SRI + raw patch SRI | tarball SRI | **berry-zip** checksum | tarball SRI | tarball SRI | tarball SRI |
| Bundled deps | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

Notes: npm-1 predates workspaces and the `packages` block, so it also has no
`peerDependenciesMeta` / `hasInstallScript` / `engines`-`os`-`cpu` / overrides.
yarn-classic's `~` cells are the **manifest-blindness axis** (below). The berry
integrity form is the single most consequential cross-family break.

## Lost / breaks — the conversion loss table

Organised by feature axis. "Direction" is the family boundary that loses it;
"Recoverable" states whether anything can bring it back.

| Feature lost | Direction (source → target) | Runtime diagnostic | Recoverable? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Integrity — berry-zip ↔ tarball SRI** | berry → npm / yarn-classic / pnpm / bun (and back) | `RECIPE_INTEGRITY_INCOMPLETE` | Only from an authoritative target checksum or by obtaining artifact bytes and **recomputing** the target's hash. Never fabricated; mutable install may refill it, but immutable/frozen install can reject the omission. |
| **Peer virtualization** | berry / pnpm → npm / yarn-classic / bun | `YARN_CLASSIC_PEER_VIRT_FLATTENED` / `NPM_V1_PEER_VIRT_FLATTENED` / `BUN_TEXT_PEER_VIRT_FLATTENED` (per target adapter) | No — flat targets model one instance per (name, version); peer-context forks collapse. |
| **Patch recipe** | berry / pnpm → npm-1/2/3, yarn-classic, bun; or → npm-4 without matching native carrier | `RECIPE_FEATURE_DROPPED` (`feature='patch'`) | npm-4 can replay its own native carrier, but cannot derive npm's raw patch SRI/path from a foreign canonical identity. |
| **npm-4 native patch carrier** | npm-4 → any non-npm-4 target | `PROJECTION_LOSS` (`feature='patch'`) | No portable replay: the raw-SRI/path pair is npm-native. Effective package facts may remain, but strict projection rejects rather than claiming a target-native patch declaration. |
| **npm-4 manifest-extension provenance** | npm-4 → any non-npm-4 target | `PROJECTION_LOSS` (`feature='manifest-extension-provenance'`) | No target carrier. Representable effective graph edges remain, but fingerprints and applied-provenance evidence are not fabricated. |
| **Root workspace version** | npm-4 → bun-text | `PROJECTION_LOSS` (`feature='workspace-root-version'`) | bun-text does not encode npm's root version; the native fixture's root `@1.0.0` would reparse as `@0.0.0`. |
| **Multiple versions behind one bun dependency name** | npm-4 → bun-text | `PROJECTION_LOSS` (`feature='bun-package-key-resolution'`) | Without source-native de-hoist keys, bun's flat dependency index cannot preserve edges simultaneously to root `is-number@7` and nested `is-number@6`; strict projection rejects. |
| **`conditions` (os/cpu/libc)** | berry v5+ → any non-berry (and berry → v4) | **— none (silent loss)** | Re-derivable on a completion mint from `os`/`cpu`/`libc` (needs the **full** manifest — corgi omits `libc`). |
| **`workspace:` protocol** | berry / pnpm / bun → npm / yarn-classic | `RECIPE_WORKSPACE_COLLAPSED` (also `_RESOLVED` / `_UNRESOLVED`) | npm keeps members via `packages/<path>` + `link`; yarn-classic keeps them only via manifests (see below). |
| **Overrides / resolutions block** | pnpm / bun (lock carriers) → npm / yarn-classic / yarn-berry (manifest-only) | `INTEROP_OVERRIDE_NOT_PROJECTED` | The resolved *graph* still reflects the pin; the re-emittable overrides *block* is lost. npm & yarn read the policy from the root manifest, never the lock (npm `package.json.overrides`, yarn `resolutions`) — so the declaration is owed to a companion manifest patch (project-level API), never synthesized into a lock the manager ignores. |
| **`catalog:` protocol** | pnpm-v9 → anything | **— none (silent)**; missing target → `RECIPE_RESOLUTION_UNKNOWN` | No equivalent elsewhere; a `catalog:` ref binds to the resolved entry the lock already carries. |
| **`dev` / `peer` classification** | any → yarn-classic **without manifests** | `YARN_CLASSIC_NO_MANIFESTS`; peer edges also `YARN_CLASSIC_PEER_DROPPED` | `dev` is recoverable with `manifests[<path>]`; **`peer` is not** — a `yarn.lock` cannot record it and yarn-classic manifest synthesis reads only `dependencies`. |
| **Bundled deps** | npm → yarn / pnpm / bun | **— none (silent)** | Carried as a `bundled` edge kind in the graph but not re-emitted by non-npm targets. |
| **`peerDependenciesMeta`** | npm-2/3/4 / berry / pnpm → npm-1 / yarn-classic | `RECIPE_PEER_META_INCOMPLETE` | Re-derivable from the member `package.json` (manifest metadata npm re-adds on install). |
| **Legacy `dependencies` mirror / workspaces** | npm-2/3/4 → npm-1 | `NPM_V1_WORKSPACES_UNSAFE`, `NPM_V1_PEER_DROPPED`, `NPM_V1_PEER_VIRT_FLATTENED` | No — npm-1 predates workspaces; members are omitted, peer edges dropped, peer context flattened. |
| **Resolution URL** (canonical berry locator) | berry → npm-1/2/3/4 / bun / pnpm | **— none (silent)**; non-recomposable locator → `RECIPE_RESOLUTION_UNKNOWN` | The registry tarball URL is recomposed from `(name, version)`; a non-registry locator that cannot be recomposed drops. |
| **Multi-descriptor entry-key set** | yarn-classic → berry, berry → yarn-classic | **— none (silent)** | Cosmetic: the merged descriptor set narrows; resolution is unaffected. |

**The two breaks that make a lock non-installable if mishandled** (both now
handled, listed because they are the sharp edges):

- **Monorepos cannot be described in a `yarn.lock` alone.** yarn 1 records a
  workspace member only when something depends on it (a `file:` entry); an
  independent member has no lock entry at all. Converting a yarn-classic
  workspace to npm/pnpm therefore requires **every** member `package.json` via
  `manifests` — the members and their dependency edges are synthesized from the
  manifests. Without them the members vanish and unhoistable transitive versions
  leak into an internal `node_modules/.lockfile-…` store key npm cannot install.
- **The dependency-scope marker (`dev`/`peer`) is not in a `yarn.lock`.** It
  lives only in `package.json`, so yarn-classic → any conversion needs
  `manifests[<workspacePath>]` to recover **`dev`** (and `optional`); without it
  `dev` collapses to `dep`. **`peer` is not recoverable from a yarn-classic
  source** — its manifest synthesis reads only `dependencies`, so a peer edge
  that was never in the lock cannot be re-derived.

## What must come from `manifests` (`package.json`)

`manifests` is keyed by workspace path (`''` = root). It supplies what the
lockfile bytes structurally cannot.

| Needed for | Which manifest | If omitted |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **yarn-classic project root** (rootless source) | `manifests['']` | A top-of-DAG dependency is promoted to the `""` root and its own installable node vanishes → fails `npm ci`. |
| **yarn-classic workspace members** (independent members absent from the lock) | `manifests[<memberPath>]` (every member) | Members are dropped; unhoistable versions leak into `.lockfile-…` keys. |
| **`dev` classification** (any → yarn-classic; workspace-member edges any family) | `manifests[<path>]` | `dev` collapses to `dep`; only `dep`/`optional` are lockfile-derivable. **`peer` is never recovered from a yarn-classic source** — its manifest synthesis reads only `dependencies`. |
| **Non-satisfying `resolutions`/overrides pin** | `manifests['']` (`native.yarnResolutions` / `overrides`) | A pin forcing a version the declared range does not satisfy, with ≥2 candidates, has no unique semver target — without the overrides the edge drops and the dependency disappears. |

Every other family (npm, berry, pnpm, bun) encodes its own root and workspace
members in the lock, so `manifests` is optional for them and only refines
`dev`/`peer`/`optional` classification of workspace-member edges.

## Project companion projection

`projectCompanionsOf(graph, { target, evidence })` projects an authoritative
canonical override policy onto the target manager's project configuration. It
is pure and returns immutable `set` operations; it never reads or writes files.
Each operation replaces only the owned value at its JSON-pointer-shaped path,
creating intermediate containers while preserving sibling fields.

| Target | Companion operation |
| --- | --- |
| npm with override support | `package.json` → `/overrides` |
| Yarn Classic / Berry | `package.json` → `/resolutions` |
| pnpm ≤10 | `package.json` → `/pnpm/overrides` |
| pnpm ≥11 | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` → `/overrides` |
| Bun | `package.json` → `/overrides` |

The result is gated independently from full project conversion: a proven
companion plan may be returned while the broader `project` contract remains
unassessed for package metadata. No patch is returned for ambiguous authority,
an unpinned load-bearing target generation, unsupported policy, or a lossy
grammar projection. Examples that fail closed include nested Bun rules, npm
`$name` references outside npm, Yarn Classic descriptor predicates and direct
dependency overrides, and Yarn Berry selectors deeper than its supported
single-parent form.

For pnpm, the same canonical authority feeds the companion operation, the lock
`overrides:` carrier, and importer specifiers. This is required because frozen
install compares importer specifiers after applying the configured override;
preserving the original direct-dependency range would make an otherwise
matching companion and lock carrier fail `--frozen-lockfile`.

## Bundled project conversion

`convertProject(input, options)` returns a lockfile and its companion operations
only when the complete `project` contract is satisfied. The result is pure and
immutable; the API never reads or writes project files. Failed or unassessed
conversions return only their structured assessment, so callers cannot apply a
partial project bundle accidentally. `projectCompanionsOf` remains available
when a caller intentionally needs the independently proven companion plan.

Repository manifests may be supplied through the existing `manifests` and
`manifestCoverage: 'complete'` convenience fields. `evidenceInputs` accepts
repository manifests, package manifests, and package-manager config authority;
these inputs are applied after the convenience manifest evidence and conflicts
fail closed. Graph-scoped target-oracle evidence is not accepted by this
pre-parse API.

The bundled output, assessment requirements, and native lock policy carrier all
consume one companion-projection runtime. No second post-emission projection is
performed, so the returned operation cannot diverge from the authority used to
emit and assess the lockfile.

## Frozen candidate and certification lifecycle

`prepareFrozen(input, options)` and `certifyFrozen(candidate, receipt)` form one
fail-closed lifecycle:

1. `prepareFrozen` requires an exact full `targetVersion`, performs the composite
   parse/enrich/evidence pipeline once, projects companions once, emits once, and
   returns an immutable opaque `FrozenCandidate` only when every non-oracle gate
   is ready. A candidate remains `contract: 'frozen', status: 'unassessed'`; it is
   a native-verification challenge, never a certified conversion.
2. A consumer-controlled runner materializes the exact lock and ordered companion
   operations in a fresh project, verifies the exact package-manager version,
   runs its native frozen/immutable command with scripts disabled, and compares
   the complete pre/post input tree byte-for-byte. The target lock, manifests,
   PM config, workspace config, and patch files are never output-allowlisted.
3. The runner issues a `FrozenVerificationReceipt` only after exit 0 and an
   unchanged input tree. `certifyFrozen` accepts only the original runtime-bound
   candidate and a receipt echoing its exact target and `projectionDigest`; it
   recomputes that digest from private candidate state before returning the same
   lockfile and companion objects with a satisfied assessment.

The `projectionDigest` hashes a versioned canonical envelope containing the exact
target format/version, target lock path and UTF-8 bytes, and ordered companion
operations. `inputDigest` separately covers the materialized pre-run project tree;
`configDigest` covers executable/runtime/config identity. No digest is generalized
to a manager major, another platform, another project tree, or a future run.

The sole pre-oracle projection exception is a classifier-produced
`berry-checksum` loss for an exact Yarn Berry target. The candidate contains the
real best-effort emitted lock bytes; the loss stays explicitly unassessed. Only
that exact candidate's successful native immutable receipt may discharge it.
Every other projection loss and every source, metadata, policy, output, or
companion gap blocks candidate creation.

Core never executes a package manager and intentionally accepts external exact-
version receipts, so the authority boundary must remain explicit:

> A receipt supplies **integrity**, not **authenticity**. It proves that the
> attestation is bound to this exact candidate and rejects stale/cross-projection
> reuse. It does not cryptographically prove that an untrusted producer actually
> ran the native PM. Lockgraph CI earns its frozen claims by executing the genuine
> pinned binaries; third-party `frozen-verified` assessments are only as reliable
> as their receipt producer or an external signed-attestation system.

The calibrated CI oracle matrix covers npm 6–12 across
`npm-1`/`npm-2`/`npm-3` and npm 12's feature-triggered `npm-4`,
Yarn 1.22.22 and 2.4.3, and pnpm 6–10 across `pnpm-v5`/`pnpm-v6`/`pnpm-v9`, subject
to each binary's Node runtime range. Bun and later Berry generations have no
bundled calibrated runner yet. External runners may attest another
profile-compatible exact version without widening that receipt's scope.

## What is pulled from the registry — and why

**Plain conversion never touches the registry.** `parse → stringify` is offline.
The historical best-effort path may omit an integrity form it cannot derive,
including a berry-zip ↔ tarball-SRI crossing, rather than fabricate a value. That
omission is not an immutable-install guarantee: assessed project conversion and
the strict raw gate keep the output withheld until the required hash is proven or
recomputed from a caller-supplied artifact source.

The registry is an **opt-in** adapter (`liveRegistry`, `lockgraph/registry`)
used by current and staged refinement paths:

| Path | What it fetches | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`completeTransitives(graph, registry, …)`** | the **packument** (all versions of a name), memoised per operation and concurrency-bounded | To wire in transitive dependencies a partial lock is missing. Resolution is deterministic for a stable response set; repeatability across runs requires a frozen/snapshotted registry adapter. |
| **Minting a node / staged metadata hydration** | the packument version plus, when available, the full exact-version manifest | To materialise a version not already in the lock or fill authoritative metadata absent from an existing payload. Corgi (npm's abbreviated packument) omits fields including `libc` and `license`, so it cannot prove project metadata completeness. Berry checksum recomputation additionally needs a separate artifact source; `RegistryAdapter` does not provide tarball bytes. |
| **`audit(registryPackages(graph))`** | raw npm bulk advisories | Security audit of the graph's registry packages (severity and fix-selection stay the caller's). |

Registry routing and auth are resolved from the package-manager config, **never
guessed**, and are ecosystem-scoped (`resolveRegistry(cwd, { ecosystem })` — a
planted `.yarnrc.yml` cannot inject into an npm resolve; npm and yarn directives
never mix). A minted registry tarball is re-hosted onto the lock's own
scope-inferred registry so a `--frozen-lockfile` install does not rewrite it.

## Package-metadata completeness

The `project` contract requires authoritative package manifests for every
non-workspace package used by the graph. `full-packument`, `version-manifest`,
and `tarball-manifest` evidence can establish both presence and absence within
the closed canonical metadata universe; abbreviated/corgi packuments cannot,
because omitted fields such as `libc` and `license` remain unknown.

Coverage alone is insufficient. `packageMetadata: complete` requires the
canonical metadata already stored in each graph tarball payload to equal its
authoritative manifest projection, including authoritative absence. Detached
evidence never substitutes for graph state that an emitter cannot see. Peer
virtual variants share one TarballKey subject. Git, directory, and other
non-registry subjects remain fail-closed until a source-specific manifest
evidence input exists.

Target readiness is assessed separately from canonical completeness. A target
claims support for a metadata field only when its emitter reads that field from
the canonical tarball payload. A present field that the target cannot preserve
makes `project` conversion unsatisfied rather than silently lossy.

## Byte-identity of the target

Freeze-mode acceptance (`npm ci`, `yarn install --immutable`, `pnpm install
--frozen-lockfile`) is the final gate: only a successful oracle for the exact
manager version, platform, config, and materialized inputs proves that guarantee.
Snapshot or project assessment can prove that all modeled prerequisites are
present without generalizing an empirical result to another environment.
The npm-4 carrier and bun-shape boundaries in the loss table are projection
failures, not byte-identity exceptions: strict conversion withholds output;
only `strict: false` emits the explicitly diagnosed best-effort bytes.

For **npm and yarn**, the frozen unit is the lock **plus the root manifest**, not
the lock alone: the override policy lives in `package.json` (`overrides` /
`resolutions`), never the lock, so a project that uses overrides needs a matching
companion manifest for the target to freeze-clean — the lock carries the resolved
graph, not the policy. (pnpm/bun persist an in-lock `overrides` carrier and
additionally deep-compare it against config in frozen mode — pnpm 6–10 reject on
mismatch.)

Beyond acceptance, some targets are byte-identical to the PM's own output:

- **npm** emits `json-stringify-nice` key order (matching arborist) and preserves
  `peerDependenciesMeta` / `hasInstallScript`, so a generated `package-lock.json`
  survives even a mutable `npm install` unchanged, not only `npm ci`.
- **yarn-berry** re-emits the canonical preamble, field schedule, quoting, and
  `cacheKey`-prefixed checksums byte-for-byte (checksums recomputed byte-exact for
  cacheKey 7/8/9 via pure-JS; cacheKey 10 via optional `@yarnpkg/libzip`).
- **Cross-family** output can be semantically equivalent without being
  byte-identical to what the target PM would generate from scratch (layout and
  hoisting may be re-synthesized; `LAYOUT_PLACEMENT_RESYNTHESISED`). It is called
  frozen-clean only after the exact native oracle succeeds.

## Per-family quick reference

Headline for each source family → target family (see the loss table for the
diagnostic codes). "clean" means no known modeled feature loss after the named
sources are supplied; it does not replace native frozen verification.

| From ↓ \ To → | npm | yarn-classic | yarn-berry | pnpm | bun |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **npm** | v3↔v2 clean; v→v1 drops workspaces/peerMeta; npm-4 native carriers do not project downward | needs manifests for dev/peer + workspaces; npm-4 patch/provenance drops | overrides are manifest-only; Berry integrity needs an artifact-backed checksum; npm-4 patch/provenance drops | ordinary npm clean; npm-4 patch/provenance drops | ordinary npm clean; npm-4 additionally loses patch/provenance, root version, and multi-version edge targets |
| **yarn-classic** | needs manifests (root + members + dev/peer) | — | preamble/workspace synthesized | needs manifests for dev/peer | resolved-URL forms may drop |
| **yarn-berry** | drops peer-virt, patch, conditions; tarball integrity needs artifact evidence | drops peer-virt, patch, conditions, workspace; needs manifests | clean (v-to-v; v→v4 drops conditions) | peer virtualization is re-encoded; tarball integrity needs artifact evidence | drops peer-virt, patch, conditions |
| **pnpm** | drops peer-virt, patch, catalog | drops peer-virt, patch, workspace; needs manifests | drops catalog; preamble synthesized | clean (v-to-v; v9↔v5/6 settings drop) | drops peer-virt, patch, catalog |
| **bun** | clean | drops resolved-URL forms; needs manifests | preamble synthesized | clean | — |

`lockgraph` is the lossless waypoint: any format → `lockgraph` → the same format
round-trips graph-identical; it is the model itself serialized, not a PM lock.
