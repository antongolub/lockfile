# Architecture Decision Records

Each ADR is one non-trivial architectural decision: context, choice,
consequences. ADRs are **append-only**. To revise a decision, write a new
ADR and mark the old one `superseded by ADR-NNNN`.

The set of `accepted` ADRs is the project's architectural contract. New
contributors (human or agent) read this directory to understand *why* the
spec is shaped the way it is.

## File format

See [`_template.md`](./_template.md). Each file is `NNNN-<short-slug>.md`,
zero-padded to 4 digits.

## Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `proposed`  | drafted; awaiting alignment |
| `accepted`  | locked; load-bearing for the spec |
| `superseded by ADR-NNNN` | replaced; kept for history |

> ADR-0027 §5 satisfies ADR-0026 acceptance gates 1/5/6 (the `layoutOf`/`rememberLayout` placement carrier): the #10 fix shipped 0026's replay *behaviour* via the `installPaths` sidecar; 0027 builds the read/write accessor.

> ADR-0028 amends ADR-0001's L3 definition: L3 is the **lockfile-encoded** placement
> (a `placement-map` ∣ `resolution-graph` union with abstract per-kind predicates +
> per-adapter instances), NOT a model of the on-disk tree. PnP's `.pnp` registry, the
> pnpm symlink farm, and hoist config are **downstream materialisation, not L3**
> (PnP `resolver-registry` deferred to a separate effort). ADR-0001's L3 bullet is
> superseded by ADR-0028 §11.

Next free number: **0039**.
