# `bun` — the installer **and** the runtime

> Status: **preview** (docs+source-grounded) — bun.com/docs + oven-sh/bun source
> & blog; selected behaviours version-pinned below.
> Updated: 2026-06-17.
> Provenance: **Official** (bun.com/docs + oven-sh/bun source & blog).
> Substrate: **Node.js** — see [`_common.md`](./_common.md). This doc records only
> bun's **extension** of (and divergence from) that substrate.

Bun is unusual in this family: it is **both** a package manager *and* a JavaScript
runtime with its **own module resolver**. The two faces are independent surfaces
that happen to ship in one binary:

- **As an installer** (`bun install`) it materialises a real, npm-compatible
  `node_modules` on disk — so anything that reads that tree (including stock
  `node`) works. This face is npm-shaped and inherits the
  [Node.js substrate](./_common.md): `package.json`, semver, `node_modules`
  resolution.
- **As a runtime** (`bun <file>` / `bun run`) it **replaces** Node's module
  resolution at execution time with its own implementation — resolving and
  transpiling TS/JSX directly, honouring `tsconfig` `paths`, and adding a
  `"bun"` export condition. The on-disk `node_modules` is the *input*; the
  runtime resolver is a *different* code path from `node`'s.

A converter cares about the installer face (it shapes the graph + writes the
lockfile). The runtime face is documented here because it changes which files a
given `node_modules` resolves to — material when reasoning about whether a layout
is "equivalent" across PMs ([§3](#3-resolver-mutation)).

---

## 1. Resolution

`bun install` resolves a `package.json` constraint set into a fully-pinned graph,
recorded in the lockfile. It reuses the [Node.js substrate's](./_common.md)
notion of dependency kinds (`dependencies` / `devDependencies` /
`optionalDependencies` / `peerDependencies`) and **npm semver** ranges; the
deltas are below.

### Semver & version selection

- Standard npm semver ranges. When a `bun.lock` is present and `package.json` is
  unchanged, bun treats the lockfile as authoritative and "downloads missing
  dependencies lazily" rather than re-resolving.
  [bun.com/docs/cli/install]
- **Minimum-release-age gate** (`minimumReleaseAge`, default `null`): when set,
  bun refuses to select a version younger than *N* seconds and falls back to a
  more mature one; "a stability check detects rapid bugfix patterns" and can
  prefer an older release. `minimumReleaseAgeExcludes` exempts named packages.
  This is a *supply-chain* control that perturbs which version is pinned —
  relevant to reproducibility. [bun.com/docs/cli/install,
  bun.com/docs/runtime/bunfig]

### Dedup & graph shape

- Dedup/hoisting is a **layout** concern, not a resolution one — see
  [§2](#2-linking--layout). The resolved graph is the same set of
  `name@version` instances regardless of `--linker`; only the physical
  placement changes.

### Workspaces

- `"workspaces"` in the root `package.json` (array of globs) declares members,
  same shape as npm/yarn. [bun.com/docs/pm/workspaces]
- **`workspace:` protocol** (`workspace:*`, `workspace:^`, `workspace:~`,
  `workspace:<range>`) is first-class for cross-member deps — it pins to the
  local member and is rewritten to a concrete range on publish, as in
  yarn/pnpm.
- `--filter <pattern>` scopes an install/run to a workspace subset (glob or
  path, negatable: `--filter '!pkg-c'`). [bun.com/docs/cli/install]
- `linkWorkspacePackages` (bunfig `[install]`, default `true`) controls whether
  matching local members satisfy a dependency instead of the registry.

### Catalogs

- **Catalogs** centralise a dependency version across workspace members: define
  it once in the **root** `package.json` and reference it from members via the
  **`catalog:`** protocol. A single default catalog plus **named** catalogs are
  supported — referenced as `"catalog:"` and `"catalog:<name>"` respectively
  (e.g. `"catalog:v1"`). Updating the catalog updates every referrer.
  [bun.com/docs/pm/workspaces; announced
  twitter.com/bunjavascript/status/1925074467518353452 — ships in the Bun
  release following that announcement (≈ 1.2.x mid-2025)]
  > **Open:** pin the exact introducing minor for `catalog:` / `catalogs`, and
  > confirm how a catalog reference is rendered **inside** `bun.lock` (resolved
  > to the concrete version, or carried as a `catalog:` marker). Known rough
  > edges as of 2025: `bun update` did not handle catalogs/monorepos
  > (oven-sh/bun#21236), and same-dep-different-catalog installs had bugs
  > (oven-sh/bun#21238) — flag as fidelity risks, not settled behaviour.

### Workspace install & focused (`--filter`) install

How a monorepo install scopes, and the `node_modules` it leaves behind.

- **Whole-monorepo default.** A bare `bun install` from the repo root installs
  the dependencies of **every** workspace member, de-duplicating shared
  `name@version` instances where possible, and links each local member that
  satisfies another member's dependency **in place of** the registry copy
  (gated by `linkWorkspacePackages`, [§1](#workspaces)). [bun.com/docs/pm/workspaces,
  bun.com/docs/guides/install/workspaces — accessed 2026-06-17]
- **`--filter <pattern>` scopes the operation to a workspace subset.** The
  pattern matches **package names, workspace names, or path globs** (the same
  selector grammar pnpm uses) and is negatable (`--filter '!pkg-c'`); multiple
  `--filter` flags union. `bun install --filter './packages/pkg-*'` restricts the
  install to the matched members. [bun.com/docs/cli/install,
  bun.com/docs/pm/workspaces — accessed 2026-06-17]
- **Resulting `node_modules` shape is the linker's, unchanged by the filter.**
  Filtering selects *which members* are processed; it does **not** switch layout
  strategy. With the **isolated** linker (the workspace default since **1.3**,
  [§2](#2-linking--layout)) each member gets its own `node_modules` of symlinks
  into the central `node_modules/.bun/` store; with the **hoisted** linker a
  shared dependency is lifted to the **root** `node_modules`. Bun's
  installer hoists workspace deps toward the root regardless of which member
  declared them (oven-sh/bun#7547). [bun.com/docs/install/isolated — accessed
  2026-06-17]
  > **Open:** whether `bun install --filter <one-member>` installs **only** that
  > member's dependency closure or still resolves/links the full workspace graph
  > is **not stated precisely** in the docs — treat the pruning semantics as
  > unverified, not asserted (accessed 2026-06-17). `bun add --filter` (add a dep
  > to a *specific* member, not the root) is an **open feature request**, not
  > shipped (oven-sh/bun#14719).

- **No documented exact `yarn workspaces focus` / `pnpm deploy` analog.** As of
  the sources accessed 2026-06-17, bun's published CLI exposes **no** command
  that (a) installs *only one* member's dependency set into that member while
  ignoring siblings (`yarn workspaces focus`), nor (b) emits a **pruned,
  copy-and-run-elsewhere** package directory with the workspace closure inlined
  (`pnpm deploy`). The closest primitive is `--filter` scoping plus the isolated
  linker's per-member `node_modules`; producing a self-contained deployable is
  left to the user. [bun.com/docs/pm/workspaces, bun.com/docs/cli/install —
  accessed 2026-06-17]
  > **Open:** a true `deploy`/`focus` equivalent may land in a future bun
  > minor — re-check `bun.com/docs/cli` before stating its absence as permanent;
  > stated here as *not present in the accessed docs*, not as a guarantee of
  > non-existence.

### Overrides & resolutions — **bun reads both**

- Bun honours **both** npm's `"overrides"` **and** yarn's `"resolutions"` in
  `package.json` for forcing a transitive dependency's version.
  [bun.com/docs/cli/install] This is the channel an **audit-fix** uses to pin a
  vulnerable transitive onto a safe version — an **override-pin** done by hand,
  since bun ships `bun audit` (scan) but **no `bun audit fix`**. Cross-PM
  remediation models (and where bun sits): [`audit-fix.md §4.5`](./audit-fix.md#45-bun--scan-only).
- In `bun.lock` the forced versions surface as a top-level **`overrides`** block
  (npm-shaped) regardless of which input field declared them — see
  [`bun-text.md`](../formats/bun-text.md) for the on-disk encoding and the
  verbatim round-trip / `overridesOf` projection.

### Peer dependencies

- "Peer dependencies are handled similarly to yarn. `bun install` will
  automatically install peer dependencies." Optional peers are satisfied by an
  existing dependency when one is present, else skipped.
  [bun.com/docs/cli/install]
- **No on-disk peer virtualization.** Unlike pnpm/yarn-berry, bun does **not**
  materialise peer-context nodes; peers are recorded **declaratively** in each
  package's inner block in `bun.lock`. The converter therefore parses no
  peer-virt nodes from a bun source and flattens inbound `peerContext` on emit
  (`BUN_TEXT_PEER_VIRT_FLATTENED`) — see
  [`bun-text.md`](../formats/bun-text.md).

### `trustedDependencies` (resolution-adjacent)

`trustedDependencies` is a `package.json` array that gates **lifecycle-script
execution**, not version selection — covered under [§5](#5-lifecycle). It is
load-bearing for reproducibility (it changes what ends up on disk after
postinstall) and round-trips verbatim in `bun.lock`.

---

## 2. Linking / layout

Bun installs a **real `node_modules`** by default — this is the defining
difference from yarn-berry PnP. Two linker strategies exist; the resolved graph
([§1](#1-resolution)) is identical between them, only placement differs.

### Linker strategies (`--linker`, bunfig `[install] linker`)

| Strategy | On-disk shape | Default | Since |
|----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| `hoisted` | flat, npm/yarn-classic-style shared `node_modules` (dedup by hoisting) | single-package projects | original |
| `isolated` | pnpm-style: central store at **`node_modules/.bun/`**, top-level `node_modules` holds **symlinks** into the store; a dep only sees what its own `package.json` declares | **workspaces** (since **1.3**); opt-in via `--linker=isolated` since **1.2.19** | 1.2.19 |

[bun.com/docs/install/isolated, bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.19,
bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.1] The isolated linker closes bun's "ghost dependency" gap
and is the structural analog of pnpm's `node_modules/.pnpm` store. A later
**global virtual store** (shared across projects) was added for the isolated
linker (1.3.1, oven-sh/bun#29489; bunfig `globalStore`).

- `node-linker` (`.npmrc`) / `install-strategy` are accepted as `.npmrc`
  spellings of the same choice. [bun.com/docs/pm/npmrc]
- Hoisting tunables for the isolated store: `hoistPattern` (virtual-store
  hoisting) and `publicHoistPattern` (hoist to the **root** `node_modules`),
  pnpm-compatible globs.

### Global cache

- Packages are cached **once per machine** at
  **`~/.bun/install/cache/${name}@${version}`** (pre/build tags hashed to dodge
  long-path limits). npm registry metadata is cached as a binary
  `~/.bun/install/cache/*.npm` (filenames keyed by a package-name hash).
  [bun.com/docs/cli/install] Configurable via bunfig `[install.cache] dir`;
  `disable` turns the cache off; `disableManifest` forces re-resolution of the
  latest versions.

### `--backend` (how files land from cache into `node_modules`)

Orthogonal to `--linker` — this is the **copy mechanism**, chosen for speed by
OS:

| `--backend` | Mechanism | Default on |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| `hardlink` | hard links from cache | **Linux** |
| `clonefile` | CoW `clonefile()` | **macOS** |
| `clonefile_each_dir` | per-directory clone (slower) | — |
| `copyfile` | `fcopyfile()` (macOS) / `copy_file_range()` (Linux) fallback | — |
| `symlink` | symlinks into cache; requires `--preserve-symlinks` | — |

[bun.com/docs/cli/install] None of these change graph identity — they are
performance/COW knobs and carry no fact the converter records.

---

## 3. Resolver mutation

> This is the face that makes bun more than "a faster npm." When you execute with
> **`bun`**, module resolution is bun's own implementation, **not** Node's — even
> though it starts from the same `node_modules`.

**Native in-runtime resolver, real files — no `.pnp` data file.** Bun's runtime
(`bun <file>` / `bun run`) resolves modules through its **own built-in module
resolver compiled into the bun binary**, not via stock Node and **not** by
reading a serialised resolution map such as yarn-berry's `.pnp.cjs` /
`.pnp.data.json`. Bun emits no `.pnp*` artefact of any kind. When `bun install`
runs, it materialises a **real `node_modules` on disk** per the active linker
([§2](#2-linking--layout)); that physical tree is then resolvable by **both**
bun's runtime resolver **and** stock `node`. [bun.com/docs/runtime/modules,
bun.com/docs/install/isolated; oven-sh/bun source — accessed 2026-06-17]

- **Contrast with yarn Plug'n'Play.** PnP **removes** `node_modules` and replaces
  it with a serialised lookup table (`.pnp.cjs`) that maps each
  `name@version` → an on-disk (often zipped) location, loaded by an **injected
  JavaScript resolver** that patches Node's `require`/`import`. Bun is the
  inverse on both axes: the resolver is **native code inside the runtime** (no
  injected JS shim) and it reads **ordinary unpacked files** in a real
  `node_modules`, not a map indirection. [bun.com/docs/runtime/modules; yarnpkg
  PnP — accessed 2026-06-17]

### What bun's runtime resolver does

- **Algorithm:** bun implements "the Node.js module resolution algorithm" — bare
  specifiers walk up `node_modules`. [bun.com/docs/runtime/modules] So a
  `node_modules` produced by *any* PM resolves under bun. But the resolver is
  bun's code, with extensions Node lacks:
- **TS/JSX execute directly.** `bun ./app.ts` resolves *and transpiles*
  TypeScript/JSX transparently at load — no build step, no loader hook. Stock
  `node` cannot (pre-`--experimental-strip-types`) execute `.ts` at all.
- **Extensionless resolution order** (an import of `./hello` is probed as):
  `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.mjs`, `.js`, `.cjs`, `.json`, then the `/index.*`
  directory variants in the same order. "If an extension is present, Bun will
  only check for a file with that exact extension." When importing a `.js{x}`
  specifier bun *also* probes the sibling `.ts{x}` (TS-ESM rewrite
  compatibility). [bun.com/docs/runtime/modules]
- **`tsconfig.json` `compilerOptions.paths`** are honoured for import remapping
  at runtime (also `jsconfig.json`; and `package.json` `#`-subpath imports).
  Stock `node` ignores `tsconfig` entirely.
- **`exports` condition order** bun applies, first-match-wins:
  **`"bun"` → `"node"` → `"require"` → `"import"` → `"default"`**. Falls back to
  `"module"` then `"main"` when there is no `exports`.
  [bun.com/docs/runtime/modules]
- **The `"bun"` export condition** lets a library ship **un-transpiled
  TypeScript** to npm and have bun pick it up — a bun-only resolution input that
  stock `node` and other PMs never select.
- **CJS ⇄ ESM interop is permissive:** `require()` and `import` may co-occur in
  one file; `require()` of an ES module yields its namespace object; importing
  CJS exposes `module.exports` as default + keys as named. Top-level `await` is
  the one thing that blocks `require()` (synchronicity). [bun.com/docs/runtime/modules]

### Contrast: `bun <file>` / `bun run` vs stock `node`

| Aspect | `bun <file>` | `node <file>` |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| `.ts` / `.tsx` | runs (transpiles) | needs build / `--experimental-strip-types` |
| `tsconfig paths` | honoured | ignored |
| extra export condition | adds `"bun"` (first) | none |
| extensionless probe set | TS-aware (`.tsx/.ts/...`) | `.js/.json/.node` only |
| shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node` | spawns a real `node` (bun respects shebangs) | n/a |

[bun.com/docs/runtime/modules, bun.com/docs/pm/bunx] The shebang behaviour
matters for `bunx`: an executable marked `#!/usr/bin/env node` is run under
`node`, not bun, unless the script forces bun.

- **`bun run <script>`** runs a `package.json` script; **`bun <file>`** executes
  a file directly. `[run] bun = true` (bunfig) auto-aliases `node` to bun
  inside scripts (prepends a bun symlink to `$PATH`), so a script that shells
  out to `node` transparently gets bun. `[run] shell` selects bun's own shell
  vs the system shell. [bun.com/docs/runtime/bunfig]

> **Converter relevance.** Two `node_modules` trees that are graph-equivalent can
> still resolve to **different files** under bun vs node (TS source picked via
> `"bun"`, `paths` remaps, `.ts`-over-`.js`). "Layout equivalence" claims must be
> qualified by *which runtime* reads the tree. The converter models the graph,
> not the runtime resolver — so this is a documented limit, not something it
> reconciles.

---

## 4. Environment

Configuration is layered: `bunfig.toml` (bun-native) + `.npmrc` (npm-compat) +
CLI flags, with CLI winning.

### `bunfig.toml`

Optional; bun otherwise reads `package.json` / `tsconfig.json`. Local
**`./bunfig.toml`** overrides the global **`$HOME/.bunfig.toml`** (or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.bunfig.toml`); CLI flags override both.
[bun.com/docs/runtime/bunfig] It is **one file for two faces**:

- **Runtime keys:** `preload` (scripts/plugins before run), `jsx` /
  `jsxFactory` / `jsxFragment` / `jsxImportSource`, `smol` (low-memory),
  `logLevel`, `define` (identifier→constant), `loader` (ext→loader), `telemetry`,
  `env` (toggle `.env` autoload), `console.depth`; plus `[serve]`, `[test]`,
  `[run]` blocks.
- **Install keys** (`[install]`): `registry` (URL or `{ url, token }`),
  `[install.scopes]` (per-scope registry+auth), `[install.cache]`
  (`dir`/`disable`/`disableManifest`), `dev` / `optional` / `peer` (all default
  `true`), `production`, `exact`, `ignoreScripts`, `concurrentScripts`,
  `frozenLockfile`, `dryRun`, `auto` (`"auto"|"force"|"disable"|"fallback"`),
  `prefer` (`"online"|"offline"|"latest"`), `globalDir`, `globalBinDir`,
  `linkWorkspacePackages`, `linker`, `globalStore`, `hoistPattern`,
  `publicHoistPattern`, `[install.lockfile]` (`save` default `true`, `print`
  e.g. `"yarn"`), `saveTextLockfile`, `[install.security] scanner`,
  `minimumReleaseAge` / `minimumReleaseAgeExcludes`, `ca` / `cafile`, `logLevel`.
  [bun.com/docs/runtime/bunfig]

### `.npmrc` compatibility

Bun **reads `.npmrc`** for registry + auth so existing projects work unchanged.
Honoured keys include: `registry`, `@<scope>:registry`,
`//<host>/:_authToken`, `//<host>/:_auth` (base64 `user:pass`),
`//<host>/:username` + `//<host>/:_password`, `//<host>/:email`, `ca`, `cafile`,
plus install-behaviour spellings `link-workspace-packages`, `save-exact`,
`ignore-scripts`, `dry-run`, `cache`, `omit`/`include`, `install-strategy` /
`node-linker`, `public-hoist-pattern` / `hoist-pattern`.
[bun.com/docs/pm/npmrc] Bun recommends migrating `.npmrc` → `bunfig.toml`.
  > **Open:** `.npmrc` `always-auth` and `strict-ssl` are **absent** from the
  > docs list — likely unsupported, but treat as docs-omission (unverified)
  > rather than asserted-absent until probed. Also unstated: precise
  > `.npmrc` vs `bunfig.toml` precedence when both set the same registry.

### `bunx` / `bun x` / `bun run`

- **`bunx <pkg>`** (alias **`bun x`**) auto-installs and runs a package's `bin`:
  checks the local `node_modules` first, else installs into the **global cache**
  and runs from there — bun's `npx`. ~100× faster than `npx` for locally
  installed bins. `--package <name>` disambiguates when the bin name ≠ package
  name. Respects shebangs (see [§3](#3-resolver-mutation)).
  [bun.com/docs/pm/bunx]

### `.env` auto-load

Bun **auto-loads `.env` files at runtime** (node does not). The standard
cascade — `.env`, `.env.local`, and `NODE_ENV`-specific
(`.env.development` / `.env.production` / `.env.test`) — is read into
`process.env` / `Bun.env` automatically; `[env]` / `env = false` in bunfig
disables it.
  > **Open:** confirm the exact precedence order and the full `.env.*` set bun
  > honours against `bun.com/docs/runtime/env` (page 503'd at write time).

### Bin shims

Dependency `bin` entries are linked into `node_modules/.bin` (hoisted) or
resolved through the isolated store, runnable via `bun run <bin>` /
`bunx <bin>`. Globally installed bins live under `globalBinDir`.

---

## 5. Lifecycle

Bun's headline lifecycle divergence from npm is **scripts-off-by-default**.

- **Lifecycle scripts are NOT run by default** for installed dependencies — a
  deliberate supply-chain guard. A blocked package still **installs**; only its
  `preinstall`/`install`/`postinstall` are skipped (silently).
  [bun.com/docs/guides/install/trusted]
- **`trustedDependencies`** (`package.json` array) is the opt-in: list a package
  name to permit *its* lifecycle scripts. Trust is **non-transitive** — it
  authorises only the named package, **not** that package's own dependencies;
  each must be listed individually. [bun.com/docs/guides/install/trusted]
- **Built-in default allowlist.** Bun ships a curated list of popular packages
  with known-safe install scripts (e.g. `esbuild`, `fsevents`) whose scripts run
  **without** an explicit `trustedDependencies` entry. This default applies
  **only to packages installed from npm**; `file:` / `link:` / `git:` /
  `github:` sources always require an explicit `trustedDependencies` entry.
  [bun.com/docs/guides/install/trusted]
- **Tooling:** `bun pm trust <pkg>` adds + runs a package's scripts;
  `bun pm untrusted` lists installed deps with un-run scripts awaiting trust.
- **`--concurrent-scripts`** caps parallelism (default ≈ 2× CPU count /
  `GOMAXPROCS`).
- **`--ignore-scripts`** (bunfig `ignoreScripts` / `.npmrc ignore-scripts`)
  disables **all** lifecycle scripts, including the **root** project's.
- **`[install.security] scanner`** (bunfig) registers a security-scanner package
  consulted during install — bun's prevention hook, distinct from advisory
  *audit*. Available in recent bun (1.3 Security Scanner API).

> resolution data but it changes the installed tree, so the converter carries it
> **verbatim** through a bun→bun round-trip and **strips** it for npm/yarn/pnpm

## 6. Lockfile + registry

### Lockfile

Cross-ref [`bun-text.md`](../formats/bun-text.md) /
[`bun-binary.md`](../formats/bun-binary.md) — **interaction only** here; the
on-disk encoding lives in those format specs.

- **`bun.lock`** (text, JSONC) is the **current default** lockfile, since
  **1.2**; introduced **1.1.39** behind **`--save-text-lockfile`**. Top-level
  `lockfileVersion` + `workspaces` + `packages` (+ optional `overrides`,
  `patchedDependencies`, `trustedDependencies`). The full positional encoding,
  the `configVersion` sibling, and the `lockfileVersion` value (`0` in early
  text emits, `1` in current) are specified in
  [`bun-text.md`](../formats/bun-text.md) — **not duplicated here**.
  [bun.com/docs/pm/lockfile, bun.com/blog/bun-lock-text-lockfile]
  This project currently accepts only v1: released early v0 text locks fail
  closed, while an unreleased Rust-rewrite v2 remains queued until a released
  producer and frozen oracle exist.
- **`bun.lockb`** (binary, original; default **<1.2**) is a **detect-and-reject**
  input for this project — never parsed. Migrate with
  `bun install --save-text-lockfile --frozen-lockfile --lockfile-only` then
  delete `bun.lockb`. See [`bun-binary.md`](../formats/bun-binary.md).
- **Commit it.** Bun's docs say `bun.lock` *should* be committed.
- **`--lockfile-only`** writes the lockfile without populating `node_modules`
  (but still warms the global cache with registry metadata + git/tarball deps).
  **`--no-save`** installs without writing one. **`--frozen-lockfile`** (alias
  **`bun ci`**) installs exactly from `bun.lock` and errors on `package.json`
  drift. **`[install.lockfile] print = "yarn"`** (or `--yarn`) additionally
  emits a `yarn.lock` alongside. [bun.com/docs/install/lockfile,
  bun.com/docs/cli/install]
- **Cross-PM lockfile migration (read).** On the first `bun install` with no
  `bun.lock`, bun **auto-migrates** an existing **`yarn.lock` (v1)**,
  **`package-lock.json`** (npm), or **`pnpm-lock.yaml`** (pnpm), preserving
  resolutions; the original file is left in place for manual removal.
  [bun.com/docs/install/lockfile] (This is bun's *own* importer — orthogonal to
  this project's converter, but worth noting: bun is itself a multi-format
  reader.)

### Integrity verification

How bun records and checks the expected digest of a fetched package. The on-disk
**encoding** of the digest field lives in the format specs
([`bun-text.md`](../formats/bun-text.md) /
[`bun-binary.md`](../formats/bun-binary.md)); recorded here is the **mechanism**.

- **Algorithm — Subresource-Integrity (SRI) `sha512`.** For a registry-served
  package bun carries the registry's SRI string, i.e. `sha512-<base64>` (the same
  `dist.integrity` value npm publishes; legacy entries may present `sha1`-class
  digests where that is all the registry exposes). The digest is a **whole-tarball**
  checksum, not a per-file one. [npm registry `dist.integrity` / SRI;
  bun.com/docs/pm/lockfile — accessed 2026-06-17]
- **Where the expected digest lives — `bun.lock` (text).** Each registry entry in
  the `packages` map is a positional array whose **third element carries the
  package's integrity/SRI** (registry entries) — alongside the resolved
  `name@version` and the resolution URL; non-registry sources (`github:`,
  `file:`, tarball) key on a content hash instead. The exact field position,
  optionality, and string encoding are specified in
  [`bun-text.md`](../formats/bun-text.md) — **not duplicated here**.

  > a bare positional slot, and exactly which array index holds it (accessed
  > 2026-06-17; the canonical statement belongs in `bun-text.md`).
- **Where the expected digest lives — `bun.lockb` (legacy binary).** The binary
  lockfile stores the per-package integrity hash inside its packed package
  metadata (binary structures, not text), de-duplicated with the rest of the
  string data; it is **never parsed by this project** ([§6 Lockfile]). The
  precise binary layout is in [`bun-binary.md`](../formats/bun-binary.md).
  [oven-sh/bun source — accessed 2026-06-17]
- **What is verified, and when.** On install, when a tarball is fetched (or read
  for extraction) and the entry's integrity hash is present and of a supported
  algorithm, bun **verifies the tarball against the expected digest before
  extraction** — gated internally by a `skip_verify` condition (verification runs
  when `skip_verify` is false and the hash is supported). The comparison is
  **downloaded/cache tarball bytes vs the lockfile's expected SRI**.

- **Behaviour on mismatch.** A digest that does not match aborts the install with
  bun's **`IntegrityCheckFailed`** error (surfaced as *"integrity check failed for
  tarball"* / *"IntegrityCheckFailed extracting tarball"*); it is bun's analog of
  npm's `EINTEGRITY`. Reported triggers include a stale/corrupt cache, a registry
  that re-published differing bytes, or a network-truncated download
  (oven-sh/bun#1590, #5581, #18864, #20084, #21493, #22470).

### Registry

Cross-ref [`registry/bun.md`](../registry/bun.md) +
[`registry/npm.md`](../registry/npm.md).

- Bun ships **no registry of its own** — `bun install` is a pure **npm-shape
  client** ([`registry/_common.md`](../registry/_common.md)), default
  `registry.npmjs.org`, configured via `bunfig.toml` `[install] registry` /
  `[install.scopes]` or `.npmrc`. No bun-specific wire protocol; addressing /
  tarball / metadata are whatever the configured backend serves.
- **`bun audit`** queries the configured registry's **npm advisory API** — so it
  inherits that backend's advisory support (full on npm/yarn-mirror, absent on
  nexus/npmmirror/github-packages). See
  [`registry/bun.md`](../registry/bun.md).
  > **Open (carried from `registry/bun.md`):** which advisory endpoint
  > `bun audit` calls (`advisories/bulk` vs `audits/quick`) and whether the
  > fetcher sends the corgi `Accept` header by default.

## npm-4 interoperability boundary

An npm-4 raw-SRI / path patch carrier and manifest-extension fingerprints /
applied provenance have no bun-text carrier. The native declarative-extension
fixture additionally has root `is-number@7` and nested `is-number@6`, which
bun's flat dependency index cannot address simultaneously without source-native
de-hoist keys; bun-text also omits npm's root workspace version. Conversion
reports every carrier, root-identity, and edge-target loss, rejects in strict
mode, and never fabricates bun-native patch metadata. See
[`formats/bun-text.md`](../formats/bun-text.md) and
[`formats/npm-4.md`](../formats/npm-4.md).

## yarn-berry-v10 interoperability boundary

Both bun-text ↔ yarn-berry-v10 directions are contract-covered. bun's
declarative peers and flat package index cannot retain Berry virtual peer
identity, conditions, patch identity, or Berry workspace keys; its tarball SRI
also cannot stand in for a Berry zip-cache checksum. Best-effort conversion
reports the accepted loss and strict projection requires the advertised
remedies. See [`formats/bun-text.md`](../formats/bun-text.md) and
[`formats/yarn-berry-v10.md`](../formats/yarn-berry-v10.md).

## Complete conversion-matrix closure

All bun-text ordered pairs are now contract-backed. The final sparse bun cell,
bun-text ↔ yarn-berry-v7, pins the same workspace-rekey, canonical-resolution,
tarball-payload, preamble, and integrity-origin boundary documented in both
format specs and [`docs/arch/CONVERT.md`](../../arch/CONVERT.md).

## Producer behaviour measured against bun 1.3.14

- **bun rejects an internally inconsistent lock outright.** If the `workspaces`
  block names a dependency one way and the `packages` block names it another —
  for instance after an alias is resolved on one side only — bun neither repairs
  it nor warns:

  ```
  error: Failed to resolve root prod dependency '@yarnpkg/cli-dist'
  InvalidPackageInfo: failed to parse lockfile: 'bun.lock'
  ```

  There is no partial acceptance: either both blocks agree or the file is unusable.

- **A blank line separates every `packages` entry.** Across 173 scraped locks,
  166 of the 167 with an observable boundary separate every entry and none is
  mixed; `configVersion` does not predict the style. The single dense file is not
  bun output — it carries three-slot entries and no trailing commas.

## Open questions

> Consolidated from the inline `> **Open:**` markers above:
> 1. Exact introducing minor for `catalog:` / named `catalogs`, and how a
>    catalog reference is rendered inside `bun.lock`.
> 2. `.npmrc` `always-auth` / `strict-ssl` support (docs-omission → unverified)
>    and `.npmrc` vs `bunfig.toml` registry precedence.
> 3. Full `.env.*` cascade + precedence (`runtime/env` page 503'd at write time).
> 4. (carried) `bun audit` advisory endpoint + corgi `Accept` header.
> 5. Auto-install runtime mode ([§3](#3-resolver-mutation)): is it on by default
>    for `bun run` of a project that has a lockfile but an empty `node_modules`?
> 6. Focused install ([§1 — Workspace install & focused install](#1-resolution)):
>    does `bun install --filter <one-member>` prune to that member's closure or still
>    resolve the full workspace graph? Is there any `yarn workspaces focus` /
>    `pnpm deploy` analog in a current or planned bun release?
> 7. Integrity ([§6](#integrity-verification)): named `"integrity"` key vs bare
>    positional slot (and array index) in the `bun.lock` text entry — canonical
>    answer belongs in `bun-text.md`; whether a cache-resident tarball is
>    re-hashed on every read or trusted once written; whether a mismatch
>    auto-evicts + re-downloads or only errors.
