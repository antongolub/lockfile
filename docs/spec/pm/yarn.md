# `yarn` — Yarn package manager (classic v1 + berry v2+)

This is a **behavior spec for the package manager**, not for its lockfile
(those live under [`docs/spec/formats/`](../formats) — `yarn-classic.md`,
`yarn-berry-v3.md` … `yarn-berry-v10.md`) nor for its registry transport
(that is [`docs/spec/registry/`](../registry) — `yarn-mirror.md`, `npm.md`).
It records what yarn does to the **Node.js resolution substrate**: how it
lays packages on disk, and — for berry — how it *replaces Node's module
resolver wholesale*. The Node substrate that yarn extends is
[`_common.md`](./_common.md); this doc records only yarn's deviations from
it.

> **The one load-bearing fact.** Classic yarn is an npm-shaped installer: it
> writes a flat, hoisted `node_modules/` that stock Node resolves with its
> normal directory walk. **Berry's default linker (PnP) deletes that
> substrate entirely** — there is no `node_modules`, and Node's resolver is
> swapped for a generated lookup table (`.pnp.cjs`). Berry is the family's
> headline example of **resolver mutation** ([§3](#3-resolver-mutation--the-centerpiece)),
> and everything else about berry (zip cache, virtual packages, strictness,
> SDKs) falls out of that one decision.

## Lineage map

| | **yarn classic** | **yarn berry** |
|---|---|---|
| semver | `>=1 <2` (1.22.x is the last) | `>=2` (v2/v3/v4; internal lockfile schema versions ≠ release majors) |
| status | maintenance / "Classic"; frozen 2020 | active trunk (`yarnpkg/berry`) |
| config file | `.yarnrc` (custom kv) | `.yarnrc.yml` (YAML) |
| default layout | **hoisted `node_modules/`** | **PnP, no `node_modules/`** |
| lockfile | `yarn.lock` v1 (custom grammar) | `yarn.lock` v2+ (true YAML / SYML) |
| Node resolver | **stock** (directory walk) | **replaced** (PnP) by default |
| distribution | single global binary | per-repo binary in `.yarn/releases/`, pinned by `yarnPath` / Corepack |

Cite version-specific behaviour explicitly: where this doc says "berry"
unqualified it means current (v4) behaviour, and a v2/v3 divergence is
flagged inline. Releases vs lockfile schema versions are independent — a
yarn 4 release can emit `__metadata.version: 8`; the mapping is in the
[format specs](../formats).

## 1. Resolution

### 1.1 Classic (v1)

Classic resolves like **npm v3**: it walks `dependencies` /
`devDependencies` / `optionalDependencies`, applies semver against the
registry, and records the result in `yarn.lock` v1. The lockfile's
distinguishing trait is **multi-range merge**: every descriptor that
resolves to the same version is folded under one comma-joined entry —

```
"foo@^1.0.5", "foo@~1.0.5":
  version "1.0.7"
  resolved "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/foo/-/foo-1.0.7.tgz#…"
  integrity sha512-…
```

so the v1 lockfile is keyed by **descriptor-set → resolution**, not by
install path. There is no `peerDependencies` virtualization: classic emits
peer-dep *warnings* and otherwise leans on hoisting to satisfy them, exactly
as npm did pre-v7. Grammar and field schedule:
[`docs/spec/formats/yarn-classic.md`](../formats/yarn-classic.md).

### 1.2 Berry — descriptors, locators, idents

Berry formalizes resolution into three objects
([Lexicon](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/lexicon)):

- **Ident** — name (+ scope), e.g. `lodash`, `@babel/core`.
- **Descriptor** — ident + **range**, e.g. `lodash@^1.0.0`. Identifies a
  *set* of candidate packages (the input to resolution).
- **Locator** — ident + **reference**, e.g. `lodash@npm:1.2.3`. Identifies
  a *single unique* package (the output of resolution). Locators carry an
  extra comparator hash, which is how virtual instances stay distinct
  ([§1.6](#16-peer-dependency-virtualization-virtual-locators)).

A **Resolver** turns descriptors into locators and extracts manifests; a
**Fetcher** turns a locator's reference into package data
([Lexicon](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/lexicon)). Each protocol
([§1.4](#14-protocols-berry)) plugs in its own resolver+fetcher pair.

### 1.3 `resolutions` field

Both lineages honour the top-level `resolutions` field in `package.json`
to force a transitive dependency to a chosen version (a yarn extension that
predates npm `overrides`).

Like npm's `overrides`
([npm §`overrides`](./npm.md#overrides-manifest-driven-forced-replacement)),
`resolutions` is **resolve-time manifest input, not lockfile output**: yarn reads
it from `package.json` on every install and bakes the pin into the resolved graph
— it is never written *into* `yarn.lock` as a re-emittable `resolutions` block.
Classic collapses the matching consumer descriptors onto the **pinned entry key**;
berry keys the entry by the pinned descriptor (reflected in `resolution:`). Either
way the lock records only the resolved *result*, so a `resolutions` pin — in
particular one whose forced version the declared range does **not** satisfy —
cannot be reconstructed from a `yarn.lock` alone; recovering the block needs the
root `package.json` (the converter's `manifests` input). The lockfile mechanics
are specified in [yarn-classic Capabilities](../formats/yarn-classic.md) and the
[descriptor→node ladder](../formats/_common.md#5-descriptornode-resolution-yarn-family-parse).

Berry additionally exposes
**`packageExtensions`** in `.yarnrc.yml` to *add* missing
dependencies/peerDependencies to third-party manifests without forking them
— the supported way to repair under-declared packages that PnP's
strictness ([§3.4](#34-strictness--undeclared-dependency-errors)) would
otherwise reject.

### 1.4 Protocols (berry)

Berry's reference is a fully-qualified locator whose reference is
prefixed by a **protocol**. The default (a bare semver range) is the
`npm:` protocol. The full set
([yarnpkg.com/protocols](https://yarnpkg.com/protocols)):

| Protocol | Form | Points at | On-disk effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `npm:` | `npm:^1.0.0`, `npm:name@range` (alias) | registry | fetched archive in cache |
| *(default)* | `^1.0.0` | registry (= `npm:`) | as above |
| `workspace:` | `workspace:^`, `workspace:*`, `workspace:path` | a sibling workspace in the monorepo | symlink/`SOFT` link; the range token rewrites the *published* dep range, not local resolution ([Workspace Protocol](https://yarnpkg.com/protocol/workspace)) |
| `patch:` | `patch:base#./patch.diff` | a patched copy of another locator | patched package; pairs with `yarn patch` / `yarn patch-commit` ([Patch](https://yarnpkg.com/protocol/patch)) |
| `portal:` | `portal:../pkg` | a folder on disk, **with** its deps | symlink (`SOFT`) that *also* gets a PnP dependency map — unlike `link:` ([Portal](https://yarnpkg.com/protocol/portal)) |
| `link:` | `link:../folder` | an arbitrary folder, **no** deps | bare symlink; cannot carry dependencies (use `portal:` for that) ([Link](https://yarnpkg.com/protocol/link)) |
| `file:` | `file:./pkg.tgz`, `file:../dir` | local tarball / directory | copied into cache |
| `git:` / `github:` | `git@github.com:o/r.git#commit=…` | a git remote | cloned + packed; selectors below |
| `http:` / `https:` | `https://…/pkg.tgz` | a remote tarball | fetched into cache |
| `exec:` | `exec:./gen.js` | a generator script's stdout | script-produced package (experimental) |
| `jsr:` | `jsr:@scope/name` | the JSR registry | npm-compat tarball (newer berry) |

Berry also ships builtin `patch:` sources for compatibility fixes. Those
locators and any accompanying manifest/artifact facts are generated by Yarn,
not by the registry package document or a project patch file. Their syntax
eras, package-specific hashes, checksum rules, and the pinned evidence-backed
profile are specified in
[`derived-entries.md` §2](./derived-entries.md#2-yarn-builtin-compatibility-patches).

**Git selectors** use `#` + `&`-joined params, **not** `::`
([Git Protocol](https://yarnpkg.com/protocol/git)):
`#commit=<sha>`, `#head=<branch>`, `#tag=<tag>`, `#workspace=<name>`
(e.g. `org/app#head=next&workspace=my-pkg` clones a single workspace out
of a monorepo).

### 1.5 `::` bind modifiers and `__archiveUrl`

Distinct from the git `#…` selector, a `::` in a locator is a **bind
modifier** — it pins resolution-time binding parameters onto the locator.
The one seen in lockfiles is **`__archiveUrl`**: when a package is fetched
from a non-default registry that can't be reconstructed from
`npmRegistryServer` alone, berry binds the exact tarball URL into the
resolution key, e.g.

```
"react@npm:16.14.0::__archiveUrl=https://…/react/-/react-16.14.0.tgz"
```

Berry emits these when **multiple registries share one hostname but differ
by path**, or for registries like AWS CodeArtifact / JFrog Artifactory /
Nexus ([berry#4910](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/4910),
[#6021](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/6021)). They are a known
**portability hazard**: a lockfile carrying `__archiveUrl` for a host that
CI cannot reach fails with `ENOTFOUND`. The converter must treat the
`::__archiveUrl=` suffix as part of the locator identity, not strip it.
Lockfile-level handling: the berry format specs
([`docs/spec/formats/yarn-berry-v4.md`](../formats/yarn-berry-v4.md) onward).

### 1.6 Peer-dependency virtualization (virtual locators)

Berry's signature resolution behaviour. A package with `peerDependencies`
cannot have one global instance, because the peer it sees must be the
*same object* its consumer sees. Berry therefore mints a **virtual
package** per distinct peer-set: a specialized instance whose locator
reference encodes the resolved peer dependencies via a hash
([Lexicon](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/lexicon),
[Virtual Package](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/lexicon)). On disk (and in
the PnP map) virtual instances live under a path scheme

```
…/__virtual__/<hash>/<n>/…
```

where `<n>` is a dirname-pop count applied after stripping the
`__virtual__/<hash>/<n>` segment, so the virtual path physically maps back
onto the single cached copy ([PnP Spec](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec)).
This guarantees the peer-identity contract without duplicating bytes. It is
also why one `react` in `yarn info` can appear as many
`@virtual:…#npm:18.2.0` locators — each is a different peer context, not a
different download. Peer context is what makes two installs of the same
version distinct instances rather than duplicates — the same idea pnpm encodes
in its snapshot-key suffix and npm cannot encode at all.

---

## 2. Linking / layout

What "install" *writes to disk*. This is where classic and berry diverge
hardest.

### 2.1 Classic — hoisted `node_modules`

Classic produces a **flat, hoisted `node_modules/`** identical in shape to
npm's: shared transitive deps float to the top, version conflicts nest.
Stock Node resolution applies unchanged ([§3.1](#31-stock-node-resolution-the-baseline)).
Consequence: classic inherits npm's **ghost-dependency** hazard (a package
can `require` something it never declared, because hoisting happens to put
it on an ancestor path).

### 2.2 Berry — the three linkers (`nodeLinker`)

Berry's `nodeLinker` setting selects one of three layout strategies; **PnP
is the default** ([Install modes](https://yarnpkg.com/features/linkers)):

| `nodeLinker` | On-disk layout | `node_modules`? | Node resolver | Notes |
|---|---|:---:|---|---|
| **`pnp`** *(default)* | packages stay zipped in `.yarn/cache/`; a generated `.pnp.cjs` maps locator → location | **no** | **replaced** ([§3](#3-resolver-mutation--the-centerpiece)) | fastest; enables zero-installs; blocks ghost deps; needs editor SDKs |
| **`node-modules`** | classic-style **hoisted `node_modules/`**; optional hardlinks via `nmMode` | yes | stock | "perfect ecosystem compatibility"; no ghost-dep protection; imperfect hoisting |
| **`pnpm`** | `node_modules/.store` with one folder per dep, hardlinked from a global content-addressable store (default `~/.yarn/berry/index`), then **symlinked** into each consumer's `node_modules` | yes (symlink farm) | stock (via symlinks) | "middle ground": isolation of pnpm with broader compat than PnP; symlinks/hardlinks can confuse some tools |

`node-modules` and `pnpm` keep stock Node resolution; only `pnp` mutates
it. The layout model in the project: [`docs/spec/04-layouts.md`](../04-layouts.md),
[`docs/spec/decisions/0026-layout-attribution.md`](../decisions/0026-layout-attribution.md).

### 2.3 The zip cache and zero-installs

Berry stores every package as a **single zip** under `.yarn/cache/`
(`cacheFolder`, default `./.yarn/cache`; `compressionLevel` default `0`).
Under PnP, packages are **read directly out of the zip** at runtime — there
is no unzip-and-copy step ([Install modes](https://yarnpkg.com/features/linkers)).
A global cache is shared across projects by default (`enableGlobalCache:
true`). Committing `.yarn/cache/` + `.pnp.cjs` to VCS yields a
**zero-install** repo: `git clone` is already installed, `yarn install` is
a no-op ([PnP](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp)).

**On-disk naming.** `Cache.getLocatorPath` produces two shapes:

| Shape | When | Filename |
| --- | --- | --- |
| version-based | default | `<slug>-<cacheKey>.zip` |
| checksum-based | project-local mirror, checksum known | `<slug>-<contentChecksum-slice10>.zip` |

`<slug>` is `<slugifyIdent>-<protocol>-<version>-<locatorHash-slice10>`, where
`slugifyIdent` rewrites `@types/node` as `@types-node`. A version-based entry
therefore reads
`@aashutoshrathi-word-wrap-npm-1.2.6-5b1d95e487-10c0.zip`.

The 10-hex segment is the **locator** hash, not a content digest. In a global
cache holding 11,260 archives, the same package at the same version carries the
identical slice `5b1d95e487` under cacheKey `8`, `10` and `10c0` — the bytes
differ per generation, the slice does not. Every one of those 11,260 entries was
version-based; the checksum-based shape requires a project-local mirror and did
not occur (measured 2026-07-30, `~/.yarn/berry/cache`).

**Consequence for checksum recovery.** The filename identifies
`(name, version, cache generation)` and nothing more. It does **not** carry the
`checksum:` value of [§6.3](#63-integrity-verification), so a reader recovering
that value must hash the archive bytes; there is no free lookup. A cache hit
still avoids the network, which is the whole of its advantage here.

### 2.4 Focused install — `yarn workspaces focus`

A monorepo-specific **partial install**. `yarn workspaces focus` runs an
install **as if the selected workspaces (and only the workspaces they
depend on) were the only ones in the project** — every unrelated workspace,
and everything reachable *only* through an unrelated workspace, is excluded
from the install
([cli/workspaces/focus](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/workspaces/focus), acc.
2026-06-17). With no workspace named, the **active** (current-directory)
workspace is assumed
([v2 cli/workspaces/focus](https://v2.yarnpkg.com/cli/workspaces/focus/),
acc. 2026-06-17).

What is installed vs skipped:

- **Installed:** the focused workspace(s); the closure of **other
  workspaces** they depend on (each workspace dependency is materialized so
  the focused workspace can run without those siblings being *built*); and
  the **external** (registry) dependencies of that set, fetched at their
  **published versions** like any normal install.
- **Skipped:** every workspace outside that closure, and any external
  dependency reached only through a skipped workspace.

Flags ([cli/workspaces/focus](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/workspaces/focus),
acc. 2026-06-17):

- **`--production`** — install only the **production** dependencies of the
  focused set (drop `devDependencies`).
- **`-A,--all`** — install the **entire project** (all workspaces) rather
  than just the focused closure. `yarn workspaces focus --production --all`
  reproduces the old `yarn install --production` (production deps for the
  whole project).
- **`--json`** — machine-readable output.

The primary use is **CI / Docker-layer slimming**: building one
deployable workspace out of a large monorepo without paying to install (or
build) the unrelated ones, shrinking image size and install time. The
command is provided by the bundled `@yarnpkg/plugin-workspace-tools`
([cli/workspaces/focus](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/workspaces/focus), acc.
2026-06-17).

> **Open:** the *on-disk shape* of a focused install follows the active
> `nodeLinker` ([§2.2](#22-berry--the-three-linkers-nodelinker)) — under
> `node-modules` the focused workspace's sibling deps are placed in its
> `node_modules`; under `pnp` they enter the PnP map. The precise placement
> of sibling-workspace copies under each linker is **not pinned here** from
> the focus page alone.

---

## 3. Resolver mutation — the centerpiece

> **This is the family's defining trait and the reason this spec exists.**
> Stock Node finds a module by walking `node_modules` up the directory
> tree. Berry's PnP linker **removes `node_modules` and replaces that walk
> with a table lookup.** Classic does *not* do this (it ships a real
> `node_modules`); berry's `node-modules`/`pnpm` linkers do *not* either.
> Resolver mutation is **PnP-specific**.

### 3.1 Stock Node resolution (the baseline)

For contrast, the substrate PnP replaces
([`_common.md`](./_common.md#1-module-resolution--commonjs)): `require('x')` /
`import 'x'` from a file triggers `LOAD_NODE_MODULES`, which probes
`./node_modules/x`, then `../node_modules/x`, up to the filesystem root,
honouring `package.json` `main`/`exports`. The lookup is a **filesystem
walk**; what's installed is whatever physically sits in those directories.

### 3.2 What PnP generates

A PnP install emits (at the project root):

- **`.pnp.cjs`** — the **runtime + data**: a self-contained CommonJS file
  carrying the resolution tables *and* the code that installs them into
  Node. Loading it patches Node's resolver and `fs`
  ([PnP](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp)).
- **`.pnp.data.json`** — the **data alone**, machine-readable, for tools
  that want the tables without executing the runtime
  ([PnP Spec](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec), acc. 2026-06-17).
  `.pnp.cjs` embeds / reads this same data. By default the data is
  **inlined** into `.pnp.cjs` and the separate JSON file is **not** written;
  the standalone `.pnp.data.json` is emitted only when `pnpEnableInlining`
  is set to `false`
  ([PnP Spec](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec), acc. 2026-06-17).
- **`.pnp.loader.mjs`** — the **ESM loader** (only when
  `pnpEnableEsmLoader: true`, or auto in newer berry for ESM projects). It
  exports Node `resolve`/`load` hooks and is injected via
  `--experimental-loader`, because `import` does not go through the CJS
  `require` patch ([berry#2161](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/pull/2161),
  [#3782](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/3782)).

The serialized state has these **top-level fields**
([PnP Spec](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec),
[`@yarnpkg/pnp` API](https://yarnpkg.com/api/yarnpkg-pnp), acc. 2026-06-17):

- **`packageRegistryData`** — the main table; the list of every package,
  keyed **first by ident, then by reference**. Maps are serialized as
  **arrays of `[key, value]` tuples** (not JSON objects), to make ES6-`Map`
  hydration straightforward and to permit non-string keys — in particular
  `packageRegistryData` carries one entry under a **`null` ident → `null`
  reference**, which is the top-level project package
  ([PnP Spec](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec), acc. 2026-06-17).
- **`dependencyTreeRoots`** — array of `{name, reference}` locators, one per
  workspace (the roots of the dependency graph; exposed at runtime via
  `getDependencyTreeRoots()`, [§3.3](#33-how-pnpcjs-gets-into-the-process--and-how-resolution-then-works)).
- **`enableTopLevelFallback`** (bool), **`fallbackPool`**
  (`[ident, reference][]`), **`fallbackExclusionList`**
  (`[ident, reference[]][]`) — the fallback controls
  ([§3.5](#35-fallback-pnpfallbackmode)).
- **`ignorePatternData`** — an optional regex source; paths matching it are
  treated as **outside** the PnP-managed tree (resolution there falls back
  to stock behaviour rather than the table).

Each **package object** under `packageRegistryData[ident][reference]`
carries ([PnP Spec](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec), acc. 2026-06-17):

- `packageLocation` — relative path (into `.yarn/cache/…zip/` or an
  unplugged folder), always ending `/`.
- `packageDependencies` — an `[name, reference]` tuple array mapping each
  **declared** dependency name to the reference it resolves to (the edge
  set). A value may be a `[name, reference]` *pair* instead of a bare
  reference when the dependency is **aliased**.
- `packagePeers` — the set of peer-dependency names the package expects;
  these are the slots filled by virtualization ([§1.6](#16-peer-dependency-virtualization-virtual-locators)).
  Unbound peers appear in `packageDependencies` with a **`null`** reference
  until a virtual instance binds them.
- `linkType` — `"HARD"` (package-manager-owned, e.g. a cached zip) or
  `"SOFT"` (a user location, e.g. a `portal:`/`link:`/`workspace:` target).
- `discardFromLookup` (optional bool) — excludes the location from the
  reverse `findPackageLocator` path→locator scan while keeping it resolvable
  by name.

### 3.3 How `.pnp.cjs` gets into the process — and how resolution then works

`.pnp.cjs` is inert until it is **loaded into the Node process**. Yarn
arranges that three ways ([PnP](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp)):

1. **`yarn run <script>` / binaries** — yarn sets the run context so the
   `.pnp.cjs` is registered automatically; any direct/indirect `node`
   spawned from a script entry inherits it as a runtime dependency.
2. **`yarn node …`** — the recommended interpreter; forward-compatible
   shim that boots Node with PnP active.
3. **Manual** — `node --require ./.pnp.cjs script.js` (a.k.a.
   `node -r ./.pnp.cjs …`), or `NODE_OPTIONS="--require $(pwd)/.pnp.cjs"`.

Once loaded, the runtime installs **`PNP_RESOLVE(specifier, parentURL)`**
in front of Node's resolver
([PnP Spec](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec), acc. 2026-06-17):

- Node **builtins** (`fs`, `path`, …) pass through unchanged.
- **relative/absolute** specifiers (`./`, `../`, `/`) use ordinary Node
  resolution.
- **bare** specifiers (`lodash`, `@scope/x`) go to
  **`RESOLVE_TO_UNQUALIFIED`**, which walks the maps **ident → locator →
  location**:
  1. parse the specifier into an **ident** + subpath;
  2. find the **issuer's** package by calling **`findPackageLocator`** on
     the parent path (filesystem path → owning `{name, reference}` locator);
  3. read that issuer package's **`packageDependencies`** and look up the
     ident → this yields the dependency's **reference**, i.e. the resolved
     **locator** `{ident, reference}`;
  4. fetch that locator's package object and return its **`packageLocation`**
     (+ subpath) as the *unqualified* path.

  A subsequent **qualify** step (`resolveUnqualified`) appends the file
  extension or applies `package.json` `main`/`exports`/folder-index to reach
  a real file.

The lookup is **O(1) table access**, not a directory walk. Three outcomes
are possible at step 3
([PnP Spec](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec), acc. 2026-06-17):

- the ident **is** in the issuer's `packageDependencies` → resolved
  directly (the normal path; the only path under **strict** resolution for a
  third-party issuer);
- the ident is **absent**, the resolution would qualify for **fallback**,
  and `enableTopLevelFallback` is set → PnP retries against the
  **`fallbackPool`** (the would-have-been-hoisted set), unless the
  ident/issuer pair is barred by **`fallbackExclusionList`**
  ([§3.5](#35-fallback-pnpfallbackmode));
- the ident is **absent** and no fallback applies → **hard error**
  ([§3.4](#34-strictness--undeclared-dependency-errors)).

So the resolver can only ever return an **explicitly declared** edge (or a
deliberately configured fallback) — which is the whole point. Because
packages live inside zips, the runtime also **patches `fs`** so
`fs.readFile` et al. transparently read paths *inside* the cached `.zip`
archives ([Install modes](https://yarnpkg.com/features/linkers), acc.
2026-06-17).

The programmatic surface is the global **`pnpapi`** module
(`require('pnpapi')`), documented at
[advanced/pnpapi](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnpapi):

| Member | Role |
|---|---|
| `resolveToUnqualified(request, issuer, opts?)` | core lookup → path without extension |
| `resolveUnqualified(unqualified, opts?)` | add extension / folder-index |
| `resolveRequest(request, issuer, opts?)` | the two combined → fs-ready path |
| `getPackageInformation(locator)` | `{ packageLocation, packageDependencies, linkType }` for a locator |
| `getLocator(name, referencish)` | build a `{name, reference}` locator |
| `getDependencyTreeRoots()` | root locators (one per workspace) |
| `findPackageLocator(location)` | filesystem path → owning locator |
| `resolveVirtual(path)` *(yarn ext)* | strip `__virtual__/<hash>/<n>` back to the physical path |
| `VERSIONS` (`{ std: 3, … }`), `topLevel` (`{name:null, reference:null}`) | API version + root locator |

A **PackageLocator** is `{ name, reference }` (top-level uses `null`/`null`);
a **PackageInformation** is the per-package object above. Peer dependencies
surface as `packageDependencies` values that are `null` until virtualization
binds them ([advanced/pnpapi](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnpapi)).

### 3.4 Strictness — undeclared-dependency errors

The mutation's biggest behavioural consequence. Under default **strict**
mode (`pnpMode: strict`, the default), PnP **refuses** to resolve any
specifier not present in the issuer's `packageDependencies` — even if some
*other* package depends on it. The error is the well-known:

```
Your application tried to access X, but it isn't declared in your
dependencies; this makes the require call ambiguous and unsound.
```

([berry#1487](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/1487)). This
**eliminates ghost dependencies** by construction: in `node_modules` a
package can accidentally resolve an undeclared module that happened to be
hoisted to an ancestor; PnP makes that a hard failure
([berry#3033](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/3033)). Packages
that under-declare must be repaired via `packageExtensions`
([§1.3](#13-resolutions-field)). This strictness is the single most common
source of "works in npm, breaks in PnP" friction, and the reason editor
SDKs ([§4.5](#45-editor-sdks)) are mandatory.

### 3.5 Fallback (`pnpFallbackMode`)

To soften strictness, PnP keeps a **fallback pool** of packages it *would*
have hoisted to the top level. `pnpFallbackMode`
([yarnrc](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc),
default `dependencies-only`) controls who may use it:

- `none` — fully strict, no fallback.
- `dependencies-only` *(default)* — third-party packages get **no**
  fallback; only the top-level project may fall back (so your app's stray
  undeclared `require` resolves, but a dependency's does not).
- `all` — everyone may fall back (loosest).

Separately, **`pnpMode: loose`** generates the fallback-pool list and lets
resolution fall through to it for would-have-been-hoisted packages
([berry PnP](https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp)) — a compatibility shim, not
the recommended end state. These map to `enableTopLevelFallback` /
`fallbackPool` / `fallbackExclusionList` in the
[PnP data](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec).

### 3.6 The `unplugged` escape hatch

PnP's "packages stay zipped" model breaks for packages that must exist as
**real files on disk** — those with **postinstall scripts**, **native
artifacts**, or that read/modify their own source. Such packages are
**unplugged**: unzipped into `pnpUnpluggedFolder` (default
`./.yarn/unplugged`) and pointed at from the PnP map with a real path
([Lexicon](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/lexicon),
[yarnrc](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc)). A package is unplugged
**implicitly** when it declares a postinstall script or ships native files,
or **explicitly** via `dependenciesMeta.<pkg>.unplugged: true` /
`preferUnplugged: true` in its manifest. Unplugging is the controlled crack
in the "no `node_modules`" wall — and the bridge to the lifecycle axis
([§5](#5-lifecycle)), since a build script *implies* an unplug.

### 3.7 Contrast, in one line

Stock Node / classic / berry-`node-modules`: *"resolve X" = walk
directories until X is found on disk.* Berry-PnP: *"resolve X" = look X up
in the issuer's declared dependency table; if it's not there, throw.* The
first is permissive and filesystem-shaped; the second is strict and
graph-shaped. That inversion is the whole story of this section.

## 4. Environment

### 4.1 Config files — `.yarnrc` vs `.yarnrc.yml`

- **Classic:** `.yarnrc` — a **custom** key/value format (not YAML),
  cosgmiconfig-adjacent; keys like `registry`, `yarn-offline-mirror`,
  `--install.*` flag defaults. Also reads `.npmrc` for registry/auth.
- **Berry:** `.yarnrc.yml` — **YAML**, a closed/validated key set
  ([Settings](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc)). The two formats
  are **not** interchangeable; migrating v1→berry requires rewriting config.

Berry settings that change behaviour elsewhere in this spec
([Settings](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc); defaults pinned
2026-06-16):

> **Version flag.** `enableScripts` defaulting to **`false`** (third-party
> postinstall blocked unless allowlisted) is **current (v4) behaviour**
> ([Settings](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc),
> [Manifest](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest)). Earlier berry
> (and the v2 launch posture) ran build scripts more liberally; treat the
> default as version-dependent and read the project's pinned yarn release.
> See [§5](#5-lifecycle).

### 4.2 The per-repo binary

Berry is normally **vendored into the repository**, not installed globally:
`yarn set version <x>` downloads a release into **`.yarn/releases/`** and
sets **`yarnPath:`** in `.yarnrc.yml`. The global `yarn` shim detects the
project's `.yarnrc.yml` and **delegates** to that pinned binary — so every
contributor and CI runs the *exact same* yarn ([yarn set version](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/set/version)).
Yarn 4 + `yarn init` instead prefer **Corepack** (the `packageManager`
field in `package.json`), downloading to `.yarn/releases/` only when the
release can't be expressed that way or `yarnPath` is already set
([Release 4.0](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/release/4.0),
[berry#4063](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/4063)). Classic has no
equivalent — it's a single global binary.

### 4.3 `yarn dlx`

Berry's `yarn dlx <pkg>` (download-and-execute) runs a package's binary in
a throwaway temp project without polluting the local install — the berry
analogue of `npx`. Because it spins an ephemeral PnP environment, the
executed tool resolves under PnP too.

### 4.4 Plugins

Berry is plugin-extensible (`yarn plugin import`; recorded under `plugins:`
in `.yarnrc.yml`, stored in `.yarn/plugins/`). Plugins add resolvers,
fetchers, commands, and linkers — e.g. the constraints engine and the
TypeScript plugin. Classic is not pluggable.

### 4.5 Editor SDKs

Because there is no `node_modules`, editors and CLI tools that hard-code a
`node_modules` walk (TypeScript `tsc`/`tsserver`, ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
**cannot find packages under PnP**. Berry ships **`yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks`**
(e.g. `yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode`) which writes shim SDKs under
`.yarn/sdks/` that point those tools at the PnP API
([berry SDKs](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks)). This is a
**direct cost of the resolver mutation** — under `node-modules`/`pnpm`
linkers it is unnecessary.

---

## 5. Lifecycle

### 5.1 Classic

Classic runs the npm lifecycle (`preinstall`/`install`/`postinstall`,
`prepare`, `pre`/`post` wrappers around run-scripts) for dependencies and
the root, like npm. No allowlist by default.

### 5.2 Berry — scripts off by default

Berry's stance is **security-first**: with **`enableScripts: false`**
(current default), `yarn install` **does not run third-party
`postinstall`** scripts ([Settings](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc)).
**Workspaces are exempt** — your own workspaces' scripts still run, since
running an install inside your repo implies trust. To re-enable a specific
dependency's build:

- **`dependenciesMeta.<pkg>.built: true`** in `package.json` — an
  **allowlist**: only packages explicitly marked `built` run their build
  step; `built: false` downgrades a build-script warning to a notice
  ([Manifest](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest),
  [berry#1605](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/1605)).

A built package is, by necessity, **unplugged** ([§3.6](#36-the-unplugged-escape-hatch))
— it must exist as real files for its script to touch them. So lifecycle
and layout are coupled under PnP in a way they never are under
`node_modules`.

> **Version flag.** The `enableScripts: false` allowlist posture is the
> matured (v4-era) model. The original Yarn 2 launch
> ([Introducing Yarn 2](https://dev.to/arcanis/introducing-yarn-2-4eh1))
> ran scripts by default; the default tightened over the 3.x→4.x line.
> Pin behaviour to the project's `yarnPath`/`packageManager` release, not
> to "berry" generically.

### 5.3 Constraints

Berry ships a **constraints** engine (`yarn constraints`; historically
Prolog-based `constraints.pro`, now also a JS `yarn.config.cjs` API) that
declaratively enforces invariants across workspaces — e.g. "every
workspace must pin `react` to the same range", "no workspace may depend on
package X". It is a lint/repair layer over the manifest set, unique to
berry, with no classic or npm analogue.

---

## 6. Lockfile + registry

**Interaction only** — the byte-level grammar lives in the format specs,
the transport in the registry specs.

### 6.1 Lockfile

| | file | format | keyed by | cross-ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| classic | `yarn.lock` | custom YAML-like v1 (not valid YAML; `#`-comment header `# yarn lockfile v1`) | descriptor-set → resolution | [`docs/spec/formats/yarn-classic.md`](../formats/yarn-classic.md) |
| berry | `yarn.lock` | **SYML** (true-YAML superset) with `__metadata.version` | locator → `{version, resolution, dependencies, checksum, …}` | [`docs/spec/formats/yarn-berry-v3.md`](../formats/yarn-berry-v3.md) … [`v10.md`](../formats/yarn-berry-v10.md) |

Berry **auto-migrates** an older lockfile (including a v1 via
`yarn import`, or any older `__metadata.version`) to its current schema on
install. The `resolution` field is the **fully-qualified locator** —
including any `::__archiveUrl=…` bind ([§1.5](#15--bind-modifiers-and-__archiveurl))
— and `checksum` carries the integrity (prefixed with `__metadata.cacheKey`
in newer schemas). Emit invariants shared across the berry family:
[`docs/spec/formats/_common.md` §1](../formats/_common.md#1-yarn-berry-emit-invariants-version-invariant).

### 6.2 Registry

Both lineages default to **`registry.yarnpkg.com`** (`npmRegistryServer`),
a field-identical mirror of public npm whose tarball URLs point at
`registry.npmjs.org` — so default-registry lockfiles stay portable
([`docs/spec/registry/yarn-mirror.md`](../registry/yarn-mirror.md)). Per-scope
routing is `npmScopes:` (berry) / `@scope:registry=` in `.npmrc` (classic).
The npm-shape read/advisory contract is
[`docs/spec/registry/_common.md`](../registry/_common.md); the `npm:` protocol's
fetcher speaks exactly that surface. Non-default registries are where
`__archiveUrl` binds appear ([§1.5](#15--bind-modifiers-and-__archiveurl)).

**Remediation.** Neither yarn lineage ships a fix command — `yarn audit`
(classic, tree POST to full `/audits`) and `yarn npm audit` (berry, tree POST to
`/audits/quick` — **not** the npm-7 bulk endpoint; verified in the 2.4.3 bundle) are
**scan-only**. Automatic remediation is supplied by **`yarn-audit-fix`**, which
implements the npm-parity **range-bump** model (default in-range; `--force` for
SemVer-major + declared-range rewrite; `resolutions` pins left intact). Cross-PM
mechanics: [`audit-fix.md §4.4`](./audit-fix.md#44-yarn--no-native-fix--yarn-audit-fix).

### 6.3 Integrity verification

Both lineages record a per-package content hash in the lockfile and verify
the bytes against it — but the **field, the bytes hashed, the moment of the
check, and the failure mode differ**.

**Classic (v1) — `integrity`, against the fetched tarball.** A v1 entry
carries an **`integrity`** value in **Subresource Integrity (SRI)** form,
normally `sha512-<base64>`
([classic yarn.lock](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/yarn-lock/),
acc. 2026-06-17). The migration to SRI-`sha512` was added in yarn v1 and
made the default; before it, integrity was carried only as a **`sha1`**
appended to the **`resolved`** URL as a `#<hash>` suffix
(`resolved "https://…/foo-1.0.7.tgz#<sha1>"`), which classic still emits
and still honours as a legacy fallback when no `integrity` line is present
([yarn#5042 — integrity field with sha512](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/5042),
acc. 2026-06-17).

- *When:* on `yarn install`, when the package's **tarball is fetched and
  extracted** — checksums verify the integrity of every installed package
  **before its code is executed**
  ([classic yarn.lock](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/yarn-lock/),
  acc. 2026-06-17). `yarn install --integrity` / `yarn check --integrity`
  re-verify that installed contents still match the lockfile hashes
  ([classic yarn check](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/check/),
  acc. 2026-06-17).
- *Against what:* the **downloaded `.tgz`** (and, for `--check-files`, the
  extracted tree).
- *On mismatch:* the install **fails** — the package is treated as tampered
  with and is not used.

**Berry — `checksum`, against the cached zip.** A berry lockfile entry
carries a **`checksum`** field whose value is **`<cacheKey>/<hex>`**: a
`cacheKey` prefix, a `/`, then the hash (a hex-encoded `sha512` of the
**package zip** as stored in `.yarn/cache/`). The `cacheKey` prefix mirrors
**`__metadata.cacheKey`** and encodes the cache format generation (e.g.
`10`, or with the per-package compression marker `10c0`), so a cache-format
bump invalidates stored checksums wholesale; berry splits the field with an
internal `splitChecksumComponents()` to separate the `cacheKey` from the
hash
([Cache.ts](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/master/packages/yarnpkg-core/sources/Cache.ts),
acc. 2026-06-17).

- *When:* whenever berry **accesses a cached package zip** — at install, and
  also on a **zero-install** `git clone` where no fetch happens, since the
  committed `.yarn/cache/*.zip` is checksum-verified against the lockfile on
  use. Archive checksums are stored in the lockfile and **cache corruption
  is detected at install time**
  ([Offline Cache](https://yarnpkg.com/features/caching), acc. 2026-06-17).
- *Against what:* the **`.yarn/cache/<name>-<ref>-<hash>.zip`** bytes (the
  single zip per package), **not** an extracted tree — under PnP nothing is
  extracted.
- *On mismatch:* governed by **`checksumBehavior`**
  ([Settings](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc), acc. 2026-06-17):
  - **`throw`** *(default)* — `yarn install` raises **`YN0018`
    (`CACHE_CHECKSUM_MISMATCH`)** and stops; the lockfile is left unchanged
    ([Error Codes](https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/error-codes), acc.
    2026-06-17).
  - **`update`** — rewrite the **lockfile** `checksum` to match the cached
    zip (do not refetch).
  - **`reset`** — purge the cache entry and **refetch** from the registry.
  - **`ignore`** — use the existing files and skip the check (no lockfile
    change).

  The same selection is available as the **`YARN_CHECKSUM_BEHAVIOR`**
  environment variable. Separately, `yarn install --check-cache` **always
  refetches** every package and asserts its checksum against **both** the
  lockfile and the existing cache file, regardless of `checksumBehavior`
  ([yarn install](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install), acc. 2026-06-17).

The byte-level grammar of `integrity` / `checksum` (and the per-schema
`__metadata.cacheKey` evolution) lives in the format specs:
[`docs/spec/formats/yarn-classic.md`](../formats/yarn-classic.md),
[`docs/spec/formats/yarn-berry-v3.md`](../formats/yarn-berry-v3.md) onward.

> **Open:** the exact yarn v1 release that flipped the SRI-`sha512` default
> on (and the precise `--update-checksums` / `legacy` interplay) is **not
> pinned here**; verify against the frozen v1 source if a byte-exact classic
> emit is needed.

---

## Quirks

- **`enableScripts` default is `false`** in current berry (third-party
  postinstall blocked; workspaces exempt) — but it was looser in early
  berry. **Version-pin before asserting.**
- **`__archiveUrl` poisons portability** — a berry lockfile built against a
  private/host-pathed registry binds absolute tarball URLs into resolution
  keys that other environments can't reach
  ([berry#4910](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/4910)).
- **PnP strictness ≠ a bug** — "tried to access X but it isn't declared" is
  PnP working as designed; the fix is declaring the dep or a
  `packageExtensions` entry, not loosening PnP.
- **Virtual locators inflate the apparent graph** — N `@virtual:…` instances
  of one package are N peer-contexts over **one** cached copy, not N
  downloads.
- **`yarn import`** converts a v1 `yarn.lock` once; berry then owns the file
  and never reads v1 again.
- **Releases ≠ schema versions** — yarn 4 may write `__metadata.version: 8`;
  do not infer one from the other.
- **`link:` can't carry deps; `portal:` can** — a frequent footgun; a
  `link:` to a package with its own deps silently lacks them.
- **`compressionLevel: 0` by default** — zips are *stored*, not deflated, so
  `.yarn/cache/` is larger than a naive guess but faster to read.
- **`yarn workspaces focus` is a *partial* install** — it deliberately omits
  workspaces outside the focused closure; a lockfile/graph read after a
  focused install reflects an intentionally pruned on-disk state, not the
  whole project ([§2.4](#24-focused-install--yarn-workspaces-focus)).
- **Berry verifies the cache zip, not an extracted tree** — `checksum`
  hashes the `.yarn/cache/*.zip`; the check fires even on a zero-install
  `git clone` (no fetch), and on mismatch the default `checksumBehavior:
  throw` raises `YN0018` rather than silently refetching
  ([§6.3](#63-integrity-verification)).
- **A v1 lock is manifest-blind about direct deps** — because entries are
  keyed by descriptor-set→resolution ([§1.1](#11-classic-v1)), not by install
  path, a yarn-classic lock does not encode which descriptors are the
  *project's own* direct dependencies (no root→direct edge). A tool that needs
  the declared range of a direct dep — a version bump that must preserve the
  entry-key descriptor, or an audit-fixer deciding in-range vs out-of-range —
  must read `package.json` directly; the lockfile alone is not enough. berry
  locks embed the workspace deps and are not blind this way. This is the shared
  root cause of the entry-key version-bump handling and the audit-fix
  default-gate ([`audit-fix.md §4.4`](./audit-fix.md#44-yarn--no-native-fix--yarn-audit-fix)).

---

## npm-4 interoperability boundary

An npm-4 raw-SRI / path patch carrier is neither a classic lock entry nor a
berry patch locator, and npm manifest-extension fingerprints / applied
provenance have no yarn lockfile carrier. Conversion preserves representable
effective graph edges, reports both carrier losses, and rejects in strict mode;
it never fabricates yarn-native patch metadata. See the classic/berry format
specs and [`formats/npm-4.md`](../formats/npm-4.md).

## yarn-berry-v10 interoperability boundary

All 30 ordered pairs incident to `yarn-berry-v10` are contract-covered.
Within Berry the v10 body is v9-compatible: v5–v9 preserve the calibrated
graph, and only v10 → v4 drops `conditions`. Cross-family conversion keeps the
existing Berry rules: zip-cache checksums are never relabelled as tarball SRIs,
and targets without Berry virtual peers, patches, conditions, or workspace
identity report those losses. The yarn-classic boundary additionally flattens
virtual node/edge identity and peer-declaration payload metadata. Normative
details live in [`formats/yarn-berry-v10.md`](../formats/yarn-berry-v10.md)
and each target format spec.

## Complete conversion-matrix closure

All yarn ordered pairs are now contract-backed. The final sparse cells close
yarn-berry-v4…v8 against the older npm/pnpm generations and close every
cross-family yarn-berry-v7 cell, including npm-3, pnpm-v9, and bun-text.
Workspace rekeys, peer flattening, resolution/tarball loss, preamble synthesis,
and the Berry-checksum versus tarball-SRI boundary are recorded in both
endpoint format specs and [`docs/arch/CONVERT.md`](../../arch/CONVERT.md).

## Adapter mapping (this project)

| Concern | Classic | Berry |
|---|---|---|
| lockfile reader | `yarn-classic` parser | `yarn-berry-vN` (SYML) parser |
| layout the graph implies | hoisted `node_modules` | PnP map (default) / `node-modules` / `pnpm` store |
| resolver model | stock Node walk | PnP table (locator→deps), virtual peer contexts |
| protocol set | semver + `link:`/`file:`/git | full berry protocol matrix ([§1.4](#14-protocols-berry)) |
| registry adapter | `live` (yarn-mirror = npm) | `live`, plus `::__archiveUrl=` carry-through |
| modifier locus | `resolutions` | `resolutions` + `packageExtensions` + `::` binds |

The converter consumes yarn at the **lockfile + manifest** boundary; it
does **not** run PnP, but it must model PnP-shaped facts (virtual locators,
`__archiveUrl` binds, protocol prefixes) faithfully so a berry→other or
other→berry conversion round-trips. PnP's *runtime* (`.pnp.cjs`) is an
**output of install**, downstream of the graph, and out of scope for the
reader; it is documented here because it is the behaviour that makes a
yarn-berry graph mean what it means.

---

## Producer behaviour measured across 564 scraped locks

- **Yarn Classic writes bare entry keys.** `body-parser:` with no `@<range>`,
  scoped names included, appears in 7 of 142 classic locks from 7 unrelated
  repositories. The declared range is genuinely absent and **not reconstructible
  from the manifest**: manifests carry ordinary caret ranges while the keys are
  bare, and one lock resolves `@hackoregon/jinn@0.0.1` under a manifest declaring
  `^0.2.3`.

- **Berry writes no `checksum` for an entry it does not fetch as an archive.**
  Two independent causes, and neither is "the entry is patched": a conditioned
  entry excluded by the `optionalBuilds` rule, and a soft `link:` / `portal:` /
  directory-`file:` locator. 1044 builtin-patched entries **do** carry a
  checksum, so `builtin<...>` is not the discriminator — `conditions:` plus the
  link type is.

- **The cache-key prefix appears twice in Berry's history and is not implied by
  `__metadata.version`.** Early v4 writes `checksum: 2/<128hex>` inline with no
  `__metadata.cacheKey`; late v4-v7 write bare checksums beside a `cacheKey`
  line; v8 carries both forms; v9 and v10 are uniformly prefixed. The value also
  leaks project configuration — `10c0` versus `10` tracks whether
  `compressionLevel` is set. A reader must key off the presence of `/`, as
  Berry's own `Project.ts` does, never off the version number.

## Uncertainty / open

- **`enableScripts` default by release.** Current docs say `false`; the
  exact release where the default flipped (and the precise v2/v3 posture)
  is **not pinned here** — verify against the project's vendored yarn
  before relying on it. *(Flagged version-specific.)*
- **`.pnp.loader.mjs` auto-generation.** Whether the ESM loader is emitted
  automatically vs only under `pnpEnableEsmLoader: true` has shifted across
  berry minors; treat as version-dependent.
- **`pnpm` linker store path** (`~/.yarn/berry/index`) is the documented
  default but OS/-config dependent; not independently probed.
- **`jsr:` / `exec:` protocols** are newer/experimental; presence depends on
  the yarn release and enabled plugins.
- **Focused-install on-disk shape per `nodeLinker`** — the focus page
  documents *scope*, not the exact placement of sibling-workspace copies
  under each linker; flagged inline at [§2.4](#24-focused-install--yarn-workspaces-focus).
- **Berry `cacheKey` literal value by release** — the `checksum` prefix and
  `__metadata.cacheKey` (e.g. `10` vs `10c0`) track the cache-format
  generation and have changed across yarn versions; the value for a given
  release is **not enumerated here** ([§6.3](#63-integrity-verification)).
- **Classic SRI-`sha512` default cut-over** — the exact v1 release that made
  `integrity` (SRI `sha512`) the emitted default, and the `legacy` /
  `--update-checksums` interplay, is **not pinned**
  ([§6.3](#63-integrity-verification)).
- Classic-specific `.yarnrc` keys and v1 lockfile edge fields were
  **not re-fetched live** (classic.yarnpkg.com + yarnpkg.com direct fetch
  was blocked this session; details corroborated via scoped web search);
  they are cross-referenced to
  [`docs/spec/formats/yarn-classic.md`](../formats/yarn-classic.md), which was
  built from the v1 parser source.
