# `yarn-berry-v8` — yarn berry `yarn.lock` (`__metadata.version: 8`)

> Status: preview (adapter + round-trip + structured-fields suite; frozen certification contract available).
> Updated: 2026-07-13
> Provenance: **Source-only**.
> Frozen certification: `prepareFrozen` / `certifyFrozen`; this schema has no bundled calibrated producer, so certification requires an external native-PM oracle receipt from the exact target manager version.

The version-invariant emit contract — the *Graph-level roundtrip*
property, canonical form, field schedule, SYML quoting, line endings,
and `__metadata.cacheKey` threading — is shared across the yarn-berry
family and lives in [`_common.md` §1](./_common.md#1-yarn-berry-emit-invariants-version-invariant);
this spec inherits it and records only the v8-specific deltas
(cacheKey `10c0`, quoted protocol-bearing inner-block ranges, the
`<cacheKey>/<hex>` checksum form, the three
structured-fields round-trip, and the `::locator=` descriptor nuance)
inline. Modify, enrich, and optimize reference published
[ADR-0023](../decisions/0023-graph-modification-and-completion.md)
(modify / enrich) and [ADR-0024](../decisions/0024-optimize-phase.md)
(optimize) for their normative rules.

## Compatibility

### Writers — PM semvers that *emit* this format

| PM | semver range | Default? | How to opt in |
|----|--------------|:--------:|---------------|
| yarn | `>=4.0 <4.14` | ✓ | v7 was skipped — bumped 6 → 8 in 4.0.0; bumped 8 → 9 in 4.14.0 (2026-04-16) |

### Readers — PM semvers that *install* from this format

| PM | semver range | Notes |
|----|--------------|-------|
| yarn | `>=4` | older berry cannot read v8 |

## File

Same as [yarn-berry-v4](./yarn-berry-v4.md#file). yarn 4 also writes a
`packageExtensions` block in `.yarnrc.yml` more aggressively.

## Sources

- [`Project.ts` at yarn 4.0.0](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/@yarnpkg/cli/4.0.0/packages/yarnpkg-core/sources/Project.ts)
  — first stable release at v8; `parseInt(env ?? 8)` introduced (the
  `YARN_LOCKFILE_VERSION_OVERRIDE` env var dates to here too).
- [`Project.ts` at yarn 4.13.0](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/@yarnpkg/cli/4.13.0/packages/yarnpkg-core/sources/Project.ts)
  — last v8-default tag before the v9 bump.
- [Yarn 4.0 release blog](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/release/4.0) — wider
  release notes (no explicit lockfile-bump mention, useful for context).
  — release-tag walk including the 6 → 8 jump.

## Schema sketch

Same shape as v6 with the same scalar `conditions` support, but
with `__metadata.version: 8`, quoted protocol-bearing inner-block
dependency ranges (`lodash: "npm:4.17.21"`), cacheKey-prefixed
checksums (`<cacheKey>/<hex>`). Legacy corpus locks may carry
`compressionLevel` in `__metadata`, but pinned Yarn removes it on rewrite.

A real v8 entry may carry three structured fields beyond the basic
descriptor — all three round-trip:

```
"some-pkg@npm:1.0.0":
  version: 1.0.0
  resolution: "some-pkg@npm:1.0.0"
  dependencies:
    fsevents: "npm:2.3.3"
  peerDependencies:
    react: "*"
  dependenciesMeta:           # { pkg: { optional | built | … } }
    fsevents:
      optional: true
  peerDependenciesMeta:       # { peer: { optional: true } }
    react:
      optional: true
  checksum: 10c0/…
  conditions: os=darwin & cpu=arm64   # SCALAR platform gate
  languageName: node
  linkType: hard
```

Field order is yarn's exact emitter schedule (see
[`_common.md` §1.4](./_common.md#14-entry-internal-field-schedule)):
`dependencies` → `peerDependencies` → `dependenciesMeta` →
`peerDependenciesMeta` → `bin` → `checksum` → `conditions` →
`languageName` → `linkType`.

- `conditions` — a **scalar** platform-condition token (NOT a nested
  map): `os=darwin & cpu=arm64`, `os=linux`, or a grouped form like
  `(os=darwin | os=linux | os=win32 | os=freebsd)`. Gates
  platform-specific optional binaries (`@esbuild/*`, `@swc/*`,
  `@cloudflare/workerd-*`, `sharp`, `fsevents`). Carried verbatim.
- `dependenciesMeta` — `{ <pkg>: { optional|built|… } }` install hints.
- `peerDependenciesMeta` — `{ <peer>: { optional: true } }`.

## Capabilities

Parse / stringify / graph-level mutate roundtrip / enrich / optimize
implemented against the fixture matrix at
`src/test/resources/fixtures/lockfiles/*/yarn-berry-v8.lock`.

## Conversion inputs

Same as [yarn-berry-v4](./yarn-berry-v4.md#conversion-inputs).

## Integrity

The model is the shared [`_common.md` §3 integrity model](./_common.md#3-integrity-model);
this is only how yarn-berry v8 *carries* it.

- Integrity is the per-entry `checksum:` field, parsed with
  `parseBerryChecksum` (shared `_yarn-berry-core.ts`). A yarn-berry checksum
  is a **sha512 of yarn's post-processed zip-cache, NOT the tarball**, so it
  is tagged `origin: 'berry-zip'` and is **not** interchangeable with a
  tarball SRI ([`_common.md` §3.3](./_common.md#33-the-berry-zip--tarball-sri-boundary)).
  It is **not directly tarball-verifiable** — verifying it requires
  reproducing yarn's zip transform.
- **Body shape (v8, `checksumPrefix: true`).** The on-disk form is
  `<cacheKey>/<128-hex>` (e.g. `10c0/<hex>`), not raw hex. The cacheKey comes
  from a per-node captured prefix when present, else `__metadata.cacheKey` /
  the caller / the v8 default ([Emit](#emit), [Quirks](#quirks));
  `parseBerryChecksum` returns it separately as sidecar attribution. A small
  real-world v8 slice carries source-authored bare `<128-hex>` values despite
  the generation default; same-generation emit preserves that exact spelling,
  while minted and cross-generation entries still use the target prefix policy.
- Converting **into** v8 from a tarball-only source (npm / pnpm / bun /
  yarn-classic) yields **no** `berry-zip` digest, so `checksum:` is **omitted**
  with `RECIPE_INTEGRITY_INCOMPLETE` rather than fabricated from a tarball
  sha512 ([`_common.md` §3.4](./_common.md#34-omit-never-fabricate)); yarn
  recomputes it on install.
- **Conditional-checksum policy — `conditions ∩ optionalBuilds`, version-independent.**
  A `conditions:`-bearing locator is bare iff it stays in `optionalBuilds`: reachable
  only through optional paths **and** not a resolver source. A conditioned locator on a
  required path, or a patch source (`fsevents` is always builtin-patched, so its base
  `npm:` locator is hashed even when every parent edge is optional), carries a checksum
  and enrich fills a fresh one; `@esbuild/*` (exclusively-optional, no patch) stays bare.
  (An earlier revision of this spec claimed a v8 policy split keyed on the target yarn
  version at a 4.4.0 boundary — that boundary does not exist; the rule is the same in
  every generation. Corrected here.) See
  [`_common.md` §1.7.2](./_common.md#172-structural-checksum-gaps--entries-yarn-never-hashes).

## Emit

Emit (`stringify(graph, options?)`) is governed by the shared,
version-invariant yarn-berry emit contract in
[`_common.md` §1](./_common.md#1-yarn-berry-emit-invariants-version-invariant)
— normative source for the *Graph-level roundtrip* property
(`parse(stringify(parse(x))) ≡ parse(x)`), the canonical preamble,
block ordering, entry-internal field schedule, the SYML quoting
predicate (the single upstream "simple string" rule;
[`_common.md` §1.5](./_common.md#15-quoting-the-syml-quoting-predicate)),
indent, line endings (`lf` default, `crlf` opt-in), trailing newline,
`__metadata.cacheKey` threading, and the non-goals (no byte-lossless
roundtrip, no CST-grade fidelity, no unmodelled `__metadata`
resurrection). The acceptance gate
([`_common.md` §1.9](./_common.md#19-acceptance-gate)) is evaluated
against the v8 fixture set
`src/test/resources/fixtures/lockfiles/*/yarn-berry-v8.lock`. The
v8-specific deltas inherited on top of the shared contract are:

- `__metadata.version` emits the literal `8`.
- `__metadata.cacheKey` defaults to absent, but when present it is
  threaded through into the `checksum` prefix form `<cacheKey>/<hex>`.
- Inner `dependencies` / `optionalDependencies` emit the quoted
  protocol-bearing form (for example `dep: "npm:2.0.0"`).
- `conditions` are supported and round-trip as a **scalar** token via
  sidecar preservation. The value is emitted **bare** (unquoted), even
  when it contains spaces / `&` / `( | )`, to match yarn's output
  byte-for-byte.
- `dependenciesMeta` round-trips verbatim per node (a raw sidecar
  block; install-hint fidelity only — no cross-format EdgeAttrs
  modelling). Its boolean values (`optional` / `built` / `unplugged`)
  are emitted **bare** (`built: false`, not `built: "false"`), matching
  yarn — the quoting predicate leaves a bare `true`/`false` token unquoted
  directly; bare is correctness, not just fidelity — a quoted `"false"` is a
  truthy string that flips yarn's `if (meta.built)` to true (see
  [`_common.md` §1.5](./_common.md#15-quoting-the-syml-quoting-predicate)).
- `peerDependenciesMeta` round-trips through the **same emitter** as
  the pnpm→berry `peerDependenciesMeta` reconstruction (task #86): the
  captured block is the rung-0 hint, unioned with any `optional` peer
  edge, deduped by peer name (no double-emit). Its `optional: true`
  boolean is likewise emitted **bare**.
- **Unresolvable dependency references** (F8/#103) — a `dependencies:`
  or `optionalDependencies:` entry whose target package is **absent**
  from the lock (no `resolution:` entry block; the
  [descriptor→node ladder](./_common.md#52-the-resolution-ladder-normative)
  Rung 4 cannot bind it — e.g. a **multi-version** `catalog:` ref (Rung 3.6
  binds a single-sibling catalog, but a `catalog:` whose name has ≥2 versions
  in the lock falls through here), or a `resolutions`-pinned descriptor whose
  pin has no entry) is **not** a graph edge, so it cannot
  be reconstructed from the edge set on emit. It is preserved **verbatim**
  (its block, dep-name, and exact on-disk range string) in a per-node
  PM-native sidecar — the same role
  [`Node.resolution`](./_common.md#23-canonical-vs-pm-native-attribution-principle)
  plays — and re-emitted into the matching inner-block (re-sorted with the
  live edges to keep yarn's alphabetical block order), so a
  **same-format** round-trip is byte-faithful. The Rung-4
  `YARN_BERRY_UNRESOLVED_DEP` diagnostic **still fires** — preservation
  keeps **both** the bytes and the signal. This is **same-format only**:
  the sidecar lives solely in the yarn-berry adapter, so a cross-PM
  convert (yarn-berry → npm/pnpm/bun) does **not** carry these
  berry-native unresolved refs (they are not edges, and no foreign adapter
  reads the carrier). No phantom/placeholder node is minted — NodeId and
  edge identity stay clean.
- `compressionLevel` in `__metadata` is repaired like an unknown subkey; the
  current fixture corpus carries `0`, but pinned Yarn removes it on rewrite.

## Quirks

- `__metadata.cacheKey` is empirically `10c0` across the current v8 fixtures.
- Inner `dependencies` / `optionalDependencies` emit quoted
  protocol-bearing ranges, unlike v4/v5/v6's bare form.
- `checksum` values are `cacheKey/hash`, not raw sha512 hex.
- Source-authored bare checksums are accepted and preserved only for the same
  lock generation; their absence of a prefix is explicit sidecar attribution,
  not a rule for newly-minted entries.
- `conditions` is a **scalar** token (e.g. `os=darwin & cpu=arm64`),
  NOT a structured map — it is emitted bare and round-trips verbatim,
  matching the v5/v6 scalar sidecar shape. (A field-level round-trip
  sweep — task #89 — caught that the old SymlMap coercion silently
  dropped it on 100% of real locks; a value-only sweep had missed it.)
- `dependenciesMeta` and `peerDependenciesMeta` are present on most
  real-world v8 locks and round-trip; `dependenciesMeta` is emitted
  immediately before `peerDependenciesMeta`, matching yarn. Their boolean
  values (`optional` / `built` / `unplugged`) emit **bare** (`optional:
  true`, `built: false`) — like `conditions`, the single SYML quoting
  predicate leaves a bare `true`/`false` token unquoted, matching yarn;
  quoting `built: "false"` would be a truthy-string correctness bug, not a
  style nit (#89 regression).
- `compressionLevel` first appears in the current family corpus at v8; native
  mutable and immutable oracles prove it must be removed, not passed through.
- A dependency reference to a package **absent** from the lock (no
  `resolution:` entry) round-trips **verbatim** via a per-node sidecar
  rather than being dropped (F8/#103). It is observed on real v8/v9 locks
  (e.g. babel drops 38 such refs, highlight 15) — frequently a multi-version
  `catalog:` ref (a single-version `catalog:` now binds via Rung 3.6) or a
  `resolutions` pin with no entry. The
  `YARN_BERRY_UNRESOLVED_DEP` warning still fires for each. Preservation is
  **same-format only**: a cross-PM convert does not carry these (the
  carrier is a berry-adapter sidecar, and these are not graph edges).
- A `link:`/`portal:` (or locator-qualified `file:`) entry keyed with a
  `::locator=<encoded-consumer>` qualifier round-trips as the **single
  qualified** entry-key descriptor. A consumer records the dependency BARE
  in its `dependencies:` block (`<dep>: "link:packages/x"`); on emit the
  entry key is NOT padded with a spurious locator-less
  `<name>@link:packages/x` sibling (the bare form is the prefix of the
  qualified primary, which already represents that consumer, and reparse
  re-derives the qualifier). The descriptor set is byte-stable across
  parse → stringify → parse. See the
  [v9 locator-disambiguation note](./yarn-berry-v9.md) for the full
  sentinel-slot rationale (shared across v8+).
- **Entry-key descriptors — no synthesized resolved-version (B-EXACT).** yarn
  keys each entry by the **descriptor(s)** that reference it — the consumer
  **ranges** (`"@actions/core@npm:^1.2.6":`) — and stores the resolved version
  ONLY in the entry's `version:` / `resolution:` fields. The resolved version is
  **never** a key descriptor: an ordinary range entry stays range-keyed, and yarn
  does not write `"<name>@npm:<resolvedVersion>, <name>@npm:<range>"`. On a
  **same-format** round-trip the entry key is therefore re-emitted **verbatim**
  from a per-node sidecar that captures the source key descriptor list at parse —
  so `format(parse(x))` is byte-identical for every entry key (and
  `yarn install --immutable` sees no change). A **genuine** `resolutions`-pinned
  entry — keyed by its exact resolved version because the pin rewrote the
  consumer's range (`"csstype@npm:3.0.9":`, see [`_common.md` §5.1](./_common.md#51-why-a-ladder-is-needed))
  — keeps that exact descriptor: it is what the source key genuinely carried, not
  a synthesized one. When the sidecar is absent (a **cross-PM** convert, a
  hand-built node, or a node the graph **replaced** on a version bump) the key is
  reconstructed from the incoming-edge ranges; a registry node gets **no**
  exact-version descriptor, with a single `<name>@npm:<version>` **name-anchor**
  added only when no key descriptor already carries `<name>@` (a cross-PM convert
  that collapsed aliased git/tarball edges onto one canonical-named node, so
  reparse can recover the name). This is the inverse of the F7/#99 ladder — the
  ladder RESOLVES a range descriptor to its node on parse; emit must not invent a
  resolved-version descriptor on the way back.
- **A completed edge to a `resolutions`-pinned node keys by the pin, not its raw
  range.** When a bare `resolutions` pin rewrote a package's descriptors to the
  exact version, yarn collapsed every matching descriptor onto the one pinned key.
  A **completed / remediated** edge that later reaches the same node (an
  `audit-fix` bump re-introducing the dep) must NOT contribute its raw
  `<name>@npm:<range>` descriptor — that extra descriptor is exactly what
  `yarn install --immutable` rejects (YN0028). Completion stamps the pin on the
  edge as [`EdgeAttrs.overrideRange`](./_common.md#44-graph); both key paths honour
  it — when a mutate adds the edge to a node **already in the lock**, the
  sidecar-maintenance diff folds the *pinned* descriptor (which already equals the
  sidecar entry → zero drift), and when the sidecar is **absent** (a minted node)
  the reconstruction keys by `overrideRange ?? range`. Non-aliased edges only.
- **Completion-minted nodes compose `conditions:` / `peerDependencies:` /
  `peerDependenciesMeta:` from STRUCTURED metadata, not a sidecar** (e.g. `audit-fix`
  pulling a platform-optional closure — `@napi-rs/*`, `@esbuild/*`, `@rollup/rollup-*`).
  This is version-invariant shared-core behaviour — the composition rules (yarn's
  `conditions` format incl. `!`-negation, the `conditionsAllowed` gate, the peer-block
  payload source, and the corgi `libc` backfill) are normative in
  [`_common.md` §1.4](./_common.md#14-entry-internal-field-schedule).

## Degradation rules

Inherits v6.

For an npm-4 source, the native raw-SRI / path patch carrier is not a
yarn-berry patch locator, and npm manifest-extension fingerprints / applied
provenance have no v8 carrier. Non-strict conversion reports both losses (while
retaining representable effective graph edges); strict projection rejects.

The yarn-berry-v10 pair is graph-lossless across the calibrated corpus. Both
formats preserve conditions and cacheKey-prefixed Berry zip checksums;
`compressionLevel` is producer-faithfully removed and the metadata version
marker changes.

The complete pair matrix also pins v8 ↔ npm-{1,2} and v8 ↔ pnpm-v{5,6}.
On v8 → npm-1 the nested-tree target loses some edges, canonical resolution
URLs, tarball payload metadata, and patch slots; v8 → npm-2 loses the canonical
resolution URL. The reverse npm-1 path preserves the representable graph and
synthesizes only the v8 preamble, while npm-2 → v8 also loses target tarball
payload metadata. Across pnpm, v8 → pnpm rekeys workspace identities and loses
tarball metadata; pnpm → v8 flattens peer-virtual ids, loses tarball metadata,
and synthesizes the v8 preamble. Cross-origin integrity is omitted rather than
relabelled between tarball SRI and Berry zip checksums.

## Fixtures

See the test-bench fixtures under [`src/test/resources/fixtures/`](../../../src/test/resources/fixtures) — `lockfiles/<case>/<format>.lock` for canonical per-case locks (`npm run build:fixtures`), `real-world/` for whole-project samples.

## Open questions

> None at preview. Fixture verification matched the documented v8
> deltas on every observed field: handshake `8`, cacheKey `10c0`,
> quoted inner dep ranges, `cacheKey/hash` checksum form, and `conditions`;
> the corpus-only `compressionLevel` field is repaired as documented below.

## Unknown `__metadata` keys

Pinned Yarn 4.13.0 removes an unrecognised `__metadata` subkey during a mutable
install. The same unstripped lock is rejected by `--immutable`, while the
repaired lock is accepted. `version` and `cacheKey` are the recognized metadata
fields; the pinned producer also removes the legacy-looking `compressionLevel`
subkey. Non-strict emit reports `YARN_BERRY_V8_UNKNOWN_METADATA_DROPPED` with
the full `__metadata.<key>` path; strict emit fails closed.
