# Lockfile schemas

Public reference for every lockfile schema this project recognises:
how to identify each, which package-manager versions emit it by
default, and which can install from it. Adapter ids match the
`FormatId` literal accepted by `parse({ format })` and required by
`stringify({ format })`.

## npm

| Adapter id | Marker | Default writer | Reader |
|------------|--------|----------------|--------|
| `npm-1`    | `lockfileVersion: 1` | npm `>=5 <7` | npm `>=5` |
| `npm-2`    | `lockfileVersion: 2` | npm `>=7 <9` | npm `>=7` |
| `npm-3`    | `lockfileVersion: 3` | npm `>=9` (default unless v4 features are active) | npm `>=7` |
| `npm-4`    | `lockfileVersion: 4` | npm `>=12` (patch / extension features) | npm `>=12` |

`npm install --lockfile-version=N` overrides the writer choice within
the supported range. npm 12 still writes v3 for an ordinary project; native
`npm patch`, `packageExtensions`, or `.npm-extension` state activates v4.
npm 11 can accept a v4-shaped file without a syntax error but does not apply
its patch semantics, so it is not a compatible v4 reader.


### The `node_modules/.lockfile-…` placeholder key

An npm lock addresses every package by its **install path**, so a package needs a place
in the tree to exist at all. A node with no consumer to nest under and whose hoisted slot
`node_modules/<name>` is already taken by a different node has no such place: npm's format
simply cannot express it. Rather than drop it — a dropped entry takes its checksum with
it, which is a bug and never an acceptable simplification — the emit parks it at

```
node_modules/.lockfile-<name>-<version>-<n>/node_modules/<name>
```

**This is a placeholder, not an install path. npm has no such store, and a lock carrying
one is not installable as-is.** It is emitted only under `strict: false`, and never
silently: the same call raises `LAYOUT_PLACEMENT_RESYNTHESISED`, a
`COMPLETENESS_OUTPUT_GRAPH_MISMATCH`, and an accepted `PROJECTION_LOSS`. Under `strict`
(the default) the conversion is refused instead.

The usual way to reach it is converting a lock whose entries are unreachable — a
yarn-classic v1 lock read WITHOUT its manifest is the common case, because a v1 lock
carries no root→direct edges, so every entry is an orphan until a manifest binds them.
Supplying the root manifest through the enrich/project path, not through
`ParseOptions.manifests` (which captures overrides, not edges), is what makes those nodes
reachable and gives them real paths.
## yarn

`yarn-classic` and `yarn-berry-*` use different lockfile schemas. The
"v" suffix on berry adapters is `__metadata.version`. Yarn classic
uses a `# yarn lockfile v1` *comment header* instead — unrelated to
berry's `__metadata`.

| Adapter id        | Marker                       | Default writer       | Reader  |
|-------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| `yarn-classic`    | `# yarn lockfile v1` header  | yarn `>=1 <2`        | yarn `>=1 <2` (native); yarn `>=2` via `yarn import` |
| `yarn-berry-v3`   | `__metadata.version: 3`      | yarn `>=2.0.0-rc.4 <2.0.0-rc.20` (pre-release only) | yarn `>=2` |
| `yarn-berry-v4`   | `__metadata.version: 4`      | yarn `>=2.0.0-rc.20 <3.1` | yarn `>=2` |
| `yarn-berry-v5`   | `__metadata.version: 5`      | yarn `=3.1.0` (one minor) | yarn `>=3.1` |
| `yarn-berry-v6`   | `__metadata.version: 6`      | yarn `>=3.2 <4`      | yarn `>=3.2` |
| `yarn-berry-v8`   | `__metadata.version: 8`      | yarn `>=4.0 <4.14`   | yarn `>=4` |
| `yarn-berry-v9`   | `__metadata.version: 9`      | yarn `>=4.14`        | yarn `>=4.14` |
| `yarn-berry-v10`  | `__metadata.version: 10`     | yarn `>=4.17.1`      | yarn `>=4.17.1` |

**Schema numbers that don't exist:**
- `__metadata.version: 1` and `2` were never used by berry.
- `__metadata.version: 7` was skipped — yarn went `6 → 8` in 4.0.0.

`YARN_LOCKFILE_VERSION_OVERRIDE` (yarn 4+) lets one binary write any
schema version it can read; structural fidelity to the canonical
writer is not guaranteed.

## pnpm

| Adapter id | Marker                   | Default writer       |
|------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| `pnpm-v5`  | `lockfileVersion: 5.x`   | pnpm `>=3 <8`  (pnpm 7 stayed on `5.4` by default) |
| `pnpm-v6`  | `lockfileVersion: '6.0'`/`'6.1'` | pnpm `>=8 <9` |
| `pnpm-v9`  | `lockfileVersion: '9.0'` | pnpm `>=9`           |

**Schema numbers that don't exist:** `7` and `8`. pnpm 9 jumped
straight from `6.x` to `9.0`.

## bun

| Adapter id    | Marker                          | Default writer | Status |
|---------------|---------------------------------|----------------|--------|
| `bun-text`    | `bun.lock` filename + JSONC     | bun `>=1.2`    | primary bun target |
| `bun-binary`  | `bun.lockb` filename + magic    | bun `<1.2`     | detect-only — not parsed |

`bun-binary` is a **permanent non-goal**: when `parse()` detects
`bun.lockb` magic bytes it throws with a hint to migrate via bun's
own tooling (`bun install --save-text-lockfile`). The library handles
the resulting `bun.lock` via the `bun-text` adapter. bun's own
binary reader stays in bun for back-compat — that is bun's
responsibility, not ours.

`bun-text` is generation **1**; generation **2** is the separate `bun-text-v2` id, so
the format id selects the integer rather than the source remembering it.
Released early v0 text locks fail closed. Version 2 shipped in bun 1.4.0 and is
the same schema — measured on a project exercising workspaces, an alias,
`overrides`, optional/peer deps and `trustedDependencies`, the two generations
are byte-identical apart from that integer. They coexist: bun 1.4 accepts a v1
lock and leaves it at 1, while bun 1.3 refuses a v2 and rewrites it down, so a
v1 lock stays v1 and only a NEW lock is a 2. Note that the integer collides with
npm-2's; detection separates them by the TOP-LEVEL `workspaces` object, which npm
also carries but only nested inside `packages[""]`.

## deno

| Adapter id | Marker | Verified writer | Scope |
|------------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| `deno-v2` | top-level `version: "2"` | measured corpus; parse/emit proof | same-format mutation; supported targets v3/v4 |
| `deno-v3` | top-level `version: "3"` | Deno 1.44.4 | same-format mutation; supported targets v2/v4 |
| `deno-v4` | top-level `version: "4"` | Deno 2.2.8 | same-format mutation; supported targets v2/v3 |
| `deno-v5` | top-level `version: "5"` | Deno 2.9.4 | same-format mutation; supported targets v2/v3/v4 |

Each adapter accepts exactly one layout. V1 is rejected. Unchanged same-format
input replays byte-exactly; JSR, remote, redirect, workspace, and unknown
top-level state remain in the shared native sidecar. Every concrete source also
supports manifest-backed npm-subgraph projection to the 16 Node-family
formats. Node-family → Deno and v2/v3/v4 → v5 fail closed.
