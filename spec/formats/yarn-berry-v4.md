# `yarn-berry-v4` — yarn berry `yarn.lock` (`__metadata.version: 4`)

> Status: preview (adapter + round-trip tested; family anchor; frozen certification contract available).
> Updated: 2026-07-13
> Provenance: **Source-only**.
> Frozen certification: `prepareFrozen` / `certifyFrozen`; the repository bundles a calibrated Yarn 2.4.3 producer for this schema, and certification requires an exact-version native-PM oracle receipt.

The version-invariant emit contract — the *Graph-level roundtrip*
property, canonical form, field schedule, SYML quoting, line endings,
and `__metadata.cacheKey` threading — is shared across the yarn-berry
family and lives in [`_common.md` §1](./_common.md#1-yarn-berry-emit-invariants-version-invariant);
this spec is the family **anchor** and records the v4-specific deltas
(no `conditions`, bare inner-block dependency ranges, the v4-only
`cacheKey: 7`, the `<cacheKey>/<hex>` checksum-prefix round-trip) plus
the patch-slot recipe detail inline. Modify, enrich, and optimize
reference published [ADR-0023](../decisions/0023-graph-modification-and-completion.md)
(modify / enrich) and [ADR-0024](../decisions/0024-optimize-phase.md)
(optimize) for their normative rules.

## File

- **Filename:** `yarn.lock`
- **Encoding:** UTF-8 YAML (true YAML, unlike classic).
- **Sibling files:**
  - `.yarnrc.yml` — for nodeLinker, npmRegistries, plugins
  - `.yarn/cache/` — content-addressable archives
  - `.pnp.cjs` (PnP) or `node_modules/` (when `nodeLinker: node-modules`)

## Sources

- [`Project.ts` at yarn 2.4.3](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/@yarnpkg/cli/2.4.3/packages/yarnpkg-core/sources/Project.ts)
  — `const LOCKFILE_VERSION = 4;` is the writer pin that produces v4.
- [`Project.ts` at yarn 3.0.0](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/@yarnpkg/cli/3.0.0/packages/yarnpkg-core/sources/Project.ts)
  — same constant; v4 was still the default until 3.1.0.
- [`Project.ts` at yarn 3.0.2](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/@yarnpkg/cli/3.0.2/packages/yarnpkg-core/sources/Project.ts)
  — last stable tag with `LOCKFILE_VERSION = 4`.
- [SYML parser](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/blob/master/packages/yarnpkg-parsers/sources/syml.ts)
  — yarn's yaml-flavoured parser used for `yarn.lock`.
- [`collab/research/lockfile-schema-history-yarn.md`](../../collab/research/lockfile-schema-history-yarn.md)
  — empirical walk across release tags.

## Schema sketch

Same shape as the later pre-v8 family, but without `conditions`, with
bare inner-block dependency ranges, and with `checksum` values that may
be EITHER a bare sha512 hex OR a `<cacheKey>/<sha512-hex>` prefixed form
— both occur in the wild (see Quirks → checksum cacheKey prefix).

## Capabilities

Parse / stringify / graph-level mutate roundtrip / enrich / optimize
implemented against the fixture matrix at
`src/test/resources/fixtures/lockfiles/*/yarn-berry-v4.lock`.

## Conversion inputs

Workspaces are named via `name@workspace:path` resolutions inside the
lockfile. File-backed `patch:` fingerprints are not self-contained:
Row 1 reads `.yarn/patches/*` under an explicit `workspaceRoot`;
omission falls through to Row 3.

| Operation | Option | Required? | Effect when omitted |
|-----------|--------|:---------:|---------------------|
| Parse     | `workspaceRoot` | no | File-backed `patch:` locators fall through to Row 3; the adapter MUST NOT default to `cwd` |
| Stringify | —      | none      | |

### Patch slot

For every node whose resolution is a `patch:` locator the adapter
populates `Node.patch` — the per-node carrier for the shared
`+patch=` [`TarballKey`](./_common.md#43-tarballkey) slot
([`_common.md` §2](./_common.md#2-patch-slot--tarballkey-sentinel)).
The adapter computes the fingerprint itself; yarn's `hash=` parameter
is **never** the canonical value — it is recorded as PM-native
attribution per the canonical-vs-PM-native attribution principle
([`_common.md` §2.3](./_common.md#23-canonical-vs-pm-native-attribution-principle))
and surfaced through the format-layer carrier, not on `Node`.

| Locator shape | Canonical input | Hash |
|---|---|---|
| File-backed, e.g. `patch:lodash@npm%3A4.17.21#./patch.diff::version=4.17.21&hash=…` | patch source bytes (the `.patch` file referenced by the `#./<path>` fragment) | sha512, lower-case hex, no prefix |
| `~builtin<compat/…>`, e.g. `patch:typescript@npm%3A5.4.5#~builtin<compat/typescript>::…` | UTF-8 bytes of `<yarn-major>:<locator>` where `<locator>` is the bare `~builtin<…>` slice (strip `patch:<spec>#` prefix and `::<params>` suffix), e.g. `4:~builtin<compat/typescript>`. yarn-major is an ambient-state input sourced from the install context when present; un-sourceable at parse time falls through to Row 3 | sha512, lower-case hex, no prefix |
| Patch input unreachable at parse time (CI artefact stripped of `.yarn/patches/`, omitted `workspaceRoot`, slim source tarball, hand-edited entry, or `~builtin<…>` with un-sourceable yarn-major) | UTF-8 bytes of the locator string **as recorded in the lockfile** — `::<params>` (`::version=…`, `::hash=…`, …) included | sentinel `unresolved-<sha256-hex>`; emit `warning` diagnostic |

**Routing.**

*Row 1* fires when (a) the locator shape is `patch:<spec>#<path>::…`,
(b) the path resolves workspace-contained, and (c) the source bytes
are readable. On (b) violation (`..`-escape, absolute path, Windows
drive, symlink): throw `LockfileError({ code: 'INVALID_INPUT' })`
per [Path confinement](#path-confinement) and terminate the parse —
caller-supplied path escapes the workspace, malformed input. On (a)
or (c) violation: fall through to Row 3 — the input is well-formed
but the canonical recipe cannot run.

*Row 2* fires when (a) the locator is `~builtin<…>` and (b)
yarn-major is sourceable from the ambient install context. On (b)
violation: fall through to Row 3 — recipe input absent.

*Row 3* covers the residual. Sentinel covers "recipe input absent";
INVALID_INPUT covers "caller provided malformed input".

**Notes on recipe-input scope.**

- *Row 2 (`<locator>`).* Bare `~builtin<…>` slice — strip the
  `patch:<spec>#` prefix and any `::<params>` suffix. Worked
  example: lockfile entry
  `patch:typescript@npm%3A5.4.5#~builtin<compat/typescript>::version=5.4.5&hash=abc123`
  → extracted slice `~builtin<compat/typescript>` → fingerprint
  input `4:~builtin<compat/typescript>` (the shared built-in recipe,
  [`_common.md` §2.1](./_common.md#21-the-patch-slot)). *Why bare
  slice:* yarn-berry ships one compat bundle
  per (yarn-major, `~builtin<…>` token) regardless of the patched
  package's version embedded in the envelope; the slice
  disambiguates compat bundles, the envelope adds spurious version
  dependence that would over-fragment the dedup space.
- *Row 3 ("verbatim").* The locator string **as recorded in the
  lockfile**, `::<params>` included. *Reject* the surface read that
  `::<params>` should be stripped as PM-native attribution under the
  attribution-vs-key principle
  ([`_common.md` §2.3](./_common.md#23-canonical-vs-pm-native-attribution-principle)):
  that principle governs the *canonical* namespace where input
  divergence breaks dedup; the sentinel namespace is by design
  PM-native and explicitly degraded
  ([`_common.md` §2.2](./_common.md#22-the-unresolved-sha256-sentinel))
  — two adapters reading the same artefact with different input
  encodings produce different sentinels intentionally, and sentinels
  do NOT participate in cross-PM identity.

Sentinel-keyed entries are read-only at the mutator layer per
[`_common.md` §4.5](./_common.md#45-mutator-coherence).

### Path confinement

The path component of a file-backed `patch:` locator (the segment
after `#`, before `::`) MUST resolve to a file under the workspace
root in the stable filesystem view the parser observes. Static
violations throw `LockfileError({ code: 'INVALID_INPUT' })` with the
offending locator in the diagnostic message.

- **Walk.** Percent-decode the path component; treat the result as
  posix-style. Reject absolute paths and Windows drive-letter
  prefixes outright. Join to the workspace root and lexically
  normalise (collapse `.`, `..`); reject if any `..` survives the
  collapse, or if the normalised result is not a strict descendant
  of the workspace root.
- **Symlinks.** Pure-JS implementations may `lstat`-walk existing
  components, open the leaf with `O_NOFOLLOW`-equivalent semantics,
  require `fstat` regular-file, and re-check containment from the
  opened fd when the runtime exposes an fd-path primitive. This MUST
  reject static symlinks and leaf swaps; a parent-directory swap
  between the walk and the leaf open remains an accepted pure-JS
  residual. A dirfd/`openat` walker is stronger, not required.
- **Hardlinks.** Permitted within the workspace filesystem. A
  hardlink cannot cross filesystem boundaries, so the workspace
  containment check carries through; no separate hardlink check is
  required.
- **FDs.** One open file descriptor per concurrent fingerprint
  computation. Read fully, close, then hash. The adapter MUST close
  the descriptor before returning the fingerprint — no FD outlives
  the patch-extraction call.

### Patch-descriptor edges

A dependency may reference its target **directly through a `patch:`
descriptor** — `"<dep>": "patch:<inner>#<patchPath>"` in a consumer's
`dependencies` / `optionalDependencies` block — rather than through a
plain `npm:` range. The consumer edge MUST resolve to the **patch
node** (the `+patch=unresolved-…` sentinel node carrying that locator),
not to the plain `npm:` base node, and not be dropped.

Two consumer forms occur in the wild; **both** resolve to the patch
node:

- **Form a — plain `npm:` range, patch on the entry's resolution.** The
  consumer declares `"<dep>": "npm:<ver>"` and the bound entry keeps the
  key `<dep>@npm:<ver>` while recording the patch only on its
  `resolution:` (e.g. resolution
  `lodash@patch:lodash@npm%3A4.17.21#./.yarn/patches/…::version=…&hash=…&locator=…`).
  Here the entry key IS the consumer's descriptor, so the ordinary
  spec-index lookup already lands on the patch node — no special handling.
- **Form b — `patch:` descriptor.** The consumer declares
  `"<dep>": "patch:<inner>#<patchPath>"`. Yarn binds an extra
  `::version=…&hash=…[&locator=…]` parameter block onto the patch
  **entry key** (`<dep>@patch:<inner>#<patchPath>::version=…&hash=…`)
  that the consumer's descriptor omits, so the bare descriptor never
  matches the entry key verbatim. The adapter resolves it by **stripping
  that trailing `::`-param block** from each patch entry's spec — taking
  everything up to the first `::` that follows the first `#` (yarn percent-encodes any
  inner locator's `#` as `%23`, so the first literal `#` is the outer
  patch-path separator) — and
  binding the consumer descriptor to the entry that strips to the same
  key. The descriptor's percent-encoded inner spec (`npm%3A…` decodes to
  `npm:…`, i.e. `lodash@npm:4.17.15`) is the identity that makes
  descriptor and locator share that stripped prefix.

**Multi-consumer disambiguation.** The same patch file applied from
different workspaces produces several distinct patch entries that strip
to one descriptor, told apart only by their `&locator=<encoded-consumer>`
qualifier (the same qualifier the `link:` / `portal:` reconstruction
uses). When more than one patch entry shares a stripped descriptor, the
consumer edge binds to the entry whose `&locator=` equals
`encodeURIComponent(<the consumer's own resolution>)`, mirroring the
`link:` / `portal:` per-consumer reconstruction. A single candidate binds
unconditionally; an ambiguous descriptor with no matching `&locator=`
stays unresolved and emits `YARN_BERRY_UNRESOLVED_DEP` rather than
guessing.

### Descriptor→node resolution ladder (shared)

The patch-descriptor and `link:` / `portal:` reconstructions above are
**Rung 1** of the version-invariant yarn-family descriptor→node ladder —
normative source [`_common.md` §5](./_common.md#5-descriptornode-resolution-yarn-family-parse).
The berry rungs are: Rung 0 (exact entry-key match) → **Rung 1** (the
patch-descriptor + `link:`/`portal:` `::locator=` fallbacks documented here)
→ Rung 2 (override map) → Rung 3 (source-gated max-satisfying semver) → Rung 3.5
(dist-tag — a `latest`/`next` descriptor binds the single registry sibling; ≥2
siblings → drop) → Rung 4 (`YARN_BERRY_UNRESOLVED_DEP` drop). Rungs 1–3.5 run
**only** on a Rung-0 miss, so the steady-state cost is one lookup. A registry edge
that bound a base node with a sibling `patch:` copy is additionally re-targeted by
the **patch-preference overlay** ([`_common.md` §5.5](./_common.md#55-patch-preference-lock-borne),
`YARN_BERRY_*_PATCH_PREFERRED` info) — the lock-borne `patchedDependencies`
behaviour, with the base left GC-able.

Rungs 2–3 close Bug #99: a yarn `resolutions` pin **rewrites the affected
entry key to the pinned descriptor** and drops the consumer's range, so a
consumer still declaring `csstype: "npm:^3.1.3"` misses Rung 0. The pin can be
**non-satisfying** (`3.0.9` ∉ `^3.1.3`) and can target a non-version
(`patch:` / `portal:`), so the **override map** (Rung 2) is required — and
since yarn writes no lock-borne resolutions, it exists only when the caller
passes `manifests` (captured per published
[ADR-0025](../decisions/0025-manifest-overrides.md)). Without `manifests`,
Rung 3 recovers only the *satisfying* slice (source-gated to registry tarballs
per [`_common.md` §5.3](./_common.md#53-the-source-awareness-invariant) — an
`npm:` range never binds a git / directory / unknown node); a non-satisfying
miss drops with `<prefix>_RESOLUTION_PIN_UNRESOLVED` (info, e.g.
`YARN_BERRY_V4_RESOLUTION_PIN_UNRESOLVED`). A Rung-3 max-satisfying tie emits
`<prefix>_AMBIGUOUS_RESOLUTION` (warning) and drops without guessing.

## Integrity

The model is the shared [`_common.md` §3 integrity model](./_common.md#3-integrity-model);
this is only how yarn-berry v4 *carries* it.

- Integrity is the per-entry `checksum:` field, parsed with
  `parseBerryChecksum` (shared `_yarn-berry-core.ts`). A yarn-berry checksum
  is a **sha512 of yarn's post-processed zip-cache, NOT the tarball**, so it
  is tagged `origin: 'berry-zip'` and is **not** interchangeable with a
  tarball SRI ([`_common.md` §3.3](./_common.md#33-the-berry-zip--tarball-sri-boundary)).
  It is **not directly tarball-verifiable** — verifying it requires
  reproducing yarn's zip transform.
- **Body shape (v4, `checksumPrefix: false`).** The default v4 shape is bare
  `<128-hex>`, but real yarn-2.0 v4 locks write the **prefixed**
  `<cacheKey>/<128-hex>` form (e.g. `2/<hex>`). `parseBerryChecksum` accepts
  both; the cacheKey prefix is captured per-node
  (`TarballPayload.berryChecksumCacheKey`) and re-emitted verbatim — see
  [Emit](#emit) and [Quirks](#quirks).
- Converting **into** v4 from a tarball-only source (npm / pnpm / bun /
  yarn-classic) yields **no** `berry-zip` digest, so `checksum:` is **omitted**
  with `RECIPE_INTEGRITY_INCOMPLETE` rather than fabricated from a tarball
  sha512 ([`_common.md` §3.4](./_common.md#34-omit-never-fabricate)); yarn
  recomputes it on install.

## Emit

Emit (`stringify(graph, options?)`) is governed by the shared,
version-invariant yarn-berry emit contract
([`_common.md` §1](./_common.md#1-yarn-berry-emit-invariants-version-invariant)
— *Graph-level roundtrip* property, canonical preamble, block ordering,
entry-internal field schedule, SYML quoting predicate, indent, line
endings, `__metadata.cacheKey` threading, non-goals), evaluated against
the v4 fixture set via the acceptance gate
([`_common.md` §1.9](./_common.md#19-acceptance-gate)). The v4-specific
emit deltas layered on top of that contract:

- `__metadata.version` emits the literal `4`.
- `__metadata.cacheKey` defaults to absent; when present (caller-supplied
  via `options.cacheKey` or sidecar-preserved from parse) it emits as
  a bare numeric literal (`cacheKey: 7` empirically — note the v4-only
  value differs from v5/v6's `8`) — pre-v8 form, no string quoting.
- Inner `dependencies` / `optionalDependencies` emit the bare form
  (for example `lodash: 4.17.21`), not v8/v9's quoted protocol.
- `checksum` values ROUND-TRIP whatever was parsed (a `berry-zip`-origin
  hash under the shared integrity model,
  [`_common.md` §3](./_common.md#3-integrity-model); berry↔berry is a pure
  hex re-encode of the same zip-cache digest per the berry-zip ≠
  tarball-SRI boundary,
  [`_common.md` §3.3](./_common.md#33-the-berry-zip--tarball-sri-boundary)):
  if the source carried a `<cacheKey>/<hex>` prefix (yarn-2.0 writes
  `2/<hex>`) the same prefix is re-emitted; a bare source stays bare. The
  cacheKey
  is captured per-node on parse (`TarballPayload.berryChecksumCacheKey`)
  rather than from `__metadata.cacheKey`, since yarn-2.0 v4 omits the
  `__metadata.cacheKey` line yet still prefixes each checksum. This is
  intentionally NOT version-gated: dropping the prefix for v4 while
  keeping v8's `10c0/` would be an internal inconsistency that yields a
  lockfile `yarn install --immutable` rejects. (`config.checksumPrefix`
  is `false` for v4 and now only governs the cross-family-convert default,
  not same-format round-trip.)
- `conditions` are NOT supported on emit (v4 predates the field;
  v5 introduced it). `conditions` is a verbatim SCALAR token (e.g.
  `os=darwin & cpu=arm64`) captured per-node as a `Map<string,string>` of
  nodeId → scalar — NOT a structured block. If a parsed/synthetic graph
  carries such a captured scalar, the v4 emitter drops it with diagnostic
  `YARN_BERRY_V4_CONDITIONS_DROPPED`.
- `compressionLevel` is not present in the v4 corpus.

## Quirks

- `__metadata.cacheKey` is empirically `7` across the current v4 fixtures.
- Inner `dependencies` / `optionalDependencies` emit bare ranges
  (`lodash: 4.17.21`), unlike v8/v9's quoted protocol form. A **complex**
  range stays bare too — `js-tokens: ^3.0.0 || ^4.0.0` is emitted unquoted,
  NOT `"^3.0.0 || ^4.0.0"` (F3c/#106): the SYML quoting predicate
  ([`_common.md` §1.5](./_common.md#15-quoting-the-syml-quoting-predicate))
  permits interior spaces and `||` in the body, so only a leading `>` or a
  `:` (the v8/v9 `npm:` protocol prefix) forces the quotes. Per-peer
  `peerDependencies` ranges follow the same rule (`react: ^16 || ^17` bare).
- `checksum` cacheKey prefix: BOTH shapes occur in the wild. yarn-2.0
  (the earliest v4 producer) writes `checksum: 2/<sha512-hex>` — the same
  `<cacheKey>/<hex>` shape v8/v9 use (`10c0/…`) — with NO
  `__metadata.cacheKey` line. Later v4 producers (and the synthetic
  fixtures generated under `src/test/resources/fixtures/lockfiles/`) write
  a bare sha512 hex. The library preserves whichever was parsed, per-node;
  see Emit.
- `conditions` are absent in the current v4 fixtures and unsupported on
  emit; the field is a verbatim SCALAR capture (a `Map<string,string>` of
  nodeId → scalar token), not a structured block. If a parsed/synthetic
  graph carries such a captured scalar, the v4 emitter drops it with
  `YARN_BERRY_V4_CONDITIONS_DROPPED`.
- `linkType: hard` vs `soft` distinguishes copied/extracted deps (registry,
  git, tarball, `patch:`) from filesystem-in-place deps (`workspace:`, `link:`,
  `portal:`, a `file:` directory link). Derived on emit — see
  [`_common.md` §1.4.1](./_common.md#141-linktype--languagename-derivation-95).
- Virtual instances appear with `virtual:<random>#<base-resolution>` keys.
  These are PEER-RESOLVED forks of one underlying package — modelled in the
  graph layer as distinct peer-context NodeIds
  ([`_common.md` §4.1](./_common.md#41-nodeid), the readable grammar that
  replaces yarn-berry's opaque `virtual:<hash>#…` form).
- Multi-spec keys (`"foo@npm:^1, foo@npm:^1.2":`) common — single value per
  entry.

## Degradation rules

| Feature | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Patches → npm-* | **strip** with diagnostic |
| Virtual instances → npm-* | **flatten** to underlying resolution |

For an npm-4 source, the native raw-SRI / path patch carrier is not a
yarn-berry patch locator, and npm manifest-extension fingerprints / applied
provenance have no v4 carrier. Non-strict conversion reports both losses (while
retaining representable effective graph edges); strict projection rejects.

For a yarn-berry-v10 source, the calibrated body is the same Berry graph shape
but v4 cannot encode `conditions`. The emitter drops that scalar with
`YARN_BERRY_V4_CONDITIONS_DROPPED`; the reverse direction synthesizes the v10
marker without inventing conditions. Berry zip checksum bytes remain
origin-compatible and are re-encoded in the target version's checksum syntax.

The complete pair matrix also pins v4 ↔ npm-{1,2} and v4 ↔ pnpm-v{5,6}.
On v4 → npm-1 the nested-tree target loses some edges, canonical resolution
URLs, tarball payload metadata, and patch slots; v4 → npm-2 loses the canonical
resolution URL. The reverse npm-1 path preserves the representable graph and
synthesizes only the v4 preamble, while npm-2 → v4 also loses target tarball
payload metadata. Across pnpm, v4 → pnpm rekeys workspace identities and loses
tarball metadata; pnpm → v4 flattens peer-virtual ids, loses tarball metadata,
and synthesizes the v4 preamble. Tarball SRI and Berry zip checksums remain
different origins in every direction and are omitted, never relabelled.

## Fixtures

See the test-bench fixtures under [`src/test/resources/fixtures/`](../../src/test/resources/fixtures) — `lockfiles/<case>/<format>.lock` for canonical per-case locks (`npm run build:fixtures`), `real-world/` for whole-project samples.

## Open questions
